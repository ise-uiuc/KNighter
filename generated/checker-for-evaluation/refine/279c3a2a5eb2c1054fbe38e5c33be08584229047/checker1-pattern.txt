## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is an off-by-one error in index validation. The code incorrectly checks the boundary condition using ">" instead of ">=" when validating the channel index. This flaw allows an index equal to PALMAS_ADC_CH_MAX, which exceeds the allocated array bounds and leads to potential buffer overflows.
