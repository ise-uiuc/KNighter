## Bug Pattern

Dereferencing an optional pointer without checking if it's NULL. In this patch, the optional GPIO array "im" is obtained using devm_gpiod_get_array_optional(), but its pointer was dereferenced (accessing ndescs and its contents) without confirming that it is non-NULL. This pattern of improper validation of an optional resource can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.
