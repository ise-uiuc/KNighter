Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. No Program State Customization Needed  
 • For this pattern, you do not need to maintain any pointer alias or state maps. The check is purely syntactic: you want to detect an if‐statement that tests the result of set_memory_decrypted() and in its true branch calls free_pages_exact().

2. Choose Callback Functions  
 • Use the checkBranchCondition callback to hook the “if” statement.  
 • Additionally, use utility functions (like findSpecificTypeInParents and findSpecificTypeInChildren) to navigate from the branch condition to the enclosing if-statement and into its then-branch.

3. Implementation Details Per Step

 Step 1. In checkBranchCondition:  
  – When the callback is triggered, examine the condition expression.  
  – Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren with the call expression type (for example, CallExpr) on the Condition to check if there is a call to set_memory_decrypted().  
  – To confirm it is the correct function, retrieve the callee’s name (using getCalleeIdentifier() and then getNameAsString()) and compare it with "set_memory_decrypted".  
  – If the condition does not involve set_memory_decrypted(), then do nothing.

 Step 2. Locate the Enclosing If-Statement:  
  – Use findSpecificTypeInParents<IfStmt>(Condition, C) to find the if-statement that uses this condition.  
  – Ensure that the if-statement was indeed generated by evaluating the set_memory_decrypted() call.

 Step 3. Analyze the “Then” Branch Body:  
  – Retrieve the then-branch (true branch) of the if-statement.  
  – Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren on the then-branch to search for a call expression invoking free_pages_exact().  
  – Check that the callee’s name equals "free_pages_exact" (by comparing the extracted identifier).

 Step 4. Report the Bug If the Pattern is Matched  
  – If the then branch contains a call to free_pages_exact, then this indicates that on error, the sensitive decrypted memory is being freed.  
  – Generate a non-fatal error node and a bug report with a short, clear message (for example: "Sensitive decrypted memory erroneously freed on error path.").  
  – Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> for creating the bug report.

--------------------------------------------------

This concise four‐step plan uses checkBranchCondition as the primary hook, navigates upward to the if-statement and downward into its body to locate the free_pages_exact() call, and reports a bug if the erroneous release pattern is detected. Follow these concrete steps in your implementation to complete the checker.
