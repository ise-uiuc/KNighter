## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied input lengths when copying data from user space. In this case, the code uses functions like copy_from_sockptr() without ensuring that optlen is at least as large as the size of the expected data type. This may lead to out‐of‐bounds memory accesses if the user provides a shorter input, which can compromise memory safety. The fix involves replacing copy_from_sockptr() with a helper (bt_copy_from_sockptr()) that validates the provided length before copying data.
