Your plan here

1. No custom program state registration is necessary.
   • Do not introduce new REGISTER_MAP or REGISTER_TRAIT variables since this bug pattern only requires checking of call arguments and their context.

2. Use the checkASTDecl callback (or inspect the FunctionDecl in checkASTCodeBody) to identify when you are inside the functions "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old" (and optionally "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt" if needed). In these functions the user‐supplied length (optlen) is expected to be validated.

3. Implement the checkPreCall callback:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept each call event.
   • Use the utility function to extract the callee name. If it equals "copy_from_sockptr", then continue.
   • Use findSpecificTypeInParents to locate the enclosing FunctionDecl.
   • Retrieve the name of the enclosing function. If it is "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old", we are in the buggy context.
   • Retrieve the third argument (the “size” being passed) from the call event.
   • Use EvaluateExprToInt to determine if the passed size is a constant (e.g. sizeof(u32) or sizeof(sec)). Since in the old version the code directly passes a fixed size rather than checking with optlen, it indicates that validation is missing.
   • If the fixed size is used without any prior condition checking the user-supplied optlen (or if no call to a validating function like bt_copy_from_sockptr is seen), generate a bug report.
   • Use generateNonFatalErrorNode (or create an error node) and then create a bug report via std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short message such as "User length not validated for copy_from_sockptr".

4. Reporting the bug:
   • When the bug condition is met in the checkPreCall callback (inside the identified function), emit the bug report immediately.
   • Make sure the message is short and clear.

This simple four‐step plan ensures that whenever the call to copy_from_sockptr is used in the context of rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old (where optlen isn’t correctly validated), your checker will flag the potential out‐of-bounds access due to unvalidated user input length.
