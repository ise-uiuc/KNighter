Your plan here

1. Decide on program state customization:
   • No custom program state maps are needed for this checker because the bug pattern can be detected directly by intercepting dangerous calls. There is no alias tracking or memory tainting required.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkPreCall as the main callback since the dangerous operation occurs at a function call (i.e., a call to copy_from_sockptr).

3. Implementation steps in checkPreCall:
   • In the checkPreCall callback, intercept any call event.
   • Use the provided utility function ExprHasName (or use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and getNameAsString()) to check if the callee function name is "copy_from_sockptr". This distinguishes the unguarded call from the safe bt_copy_from_sockptr.
   • If the callee is "copy_from_sockptr", then:
       - (Optionally) Verify that you are in the Bluetooth RFCOMM context (for example, by checking if the call is inside functions like rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old or rfcomm_sock_setsockopt) using upward traversal in the AST with findSpecificTypeInParents.
       - Retrieve the arguments of the call (the destination pointer, optval, and the fixed copy size) using the CallEvent APIs.
       - (If desired for more precision) Use EvaluateExprToInt on the expected copy size argument to see what constant size (e.g., sizeof(u32) or computed length) is being used. Optionally, check that no user input length (the optlen parameter) is being compared against this copy size.
       - Since the safe alternative uses bt_copy_from_sockptr (which accepts the optlen as a parameter), the use of copy_from_sockptr indicates a failure to perform user input length validation.
   • Report the bug if the call is unguarded:
       - Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to generate a short and clear diagnostic message like "User input length not validated before copying from user space."
       - Emit the bug report via the CheckerContext.

4. Summary of the approach:
   • The checker simply inspects each call event for a call to copy_from_sockptr.
   • When such a call is detected (and it is not the safe bt_copy_from_sockptr alternative), the checker reports a potential bug regarding missing input length validation.
   • This approach uses only checkPreCall and the utility functions provided (ExprHasName and EvaluateExprToInt) to achieve the detection, ensuring the checker stays simple and concise.

Following these steps, you can efficiently implement a CSA checker that detects this bug pattern.
