1. No need to create custom program state maps for this checker because the bug is solely about using the wrong userspace-copy API (copy_from_sockptr instead of bt_copy_from_sockptr) without a proper length check.

2. Choose the callback function:
 • Use checkPreCall to intercept function call events.

3. In checkPreCall:
 a. Check if the callee’s identifier is "copy_from_sockptr".
  – Use the provided utility function (e.g. getNameAsString() or call.getCalleeIdentifier()) to obtain the function name.
 b. If the call is indeed to copy_from_sockptr, then the checker has found a bug pattern where the user-supplied length optlen is not being validated.
 c. Emit a bug report using a short clear message (for example, "User-supplied length not validated before user-to-kernel copy").
  – Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to create the report.
  – Call C.emitReport(...) to warn the user.

4. (Optional) If needed later, additional file scope filtering can be implemented by checking if the call is occurring within functions whose names contain "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt" or "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old". This extra filtering ensures that false positives are minimized, but it is not strictly needed to detect the pattern.

This simple plan using the checkPreCall callback and our utility for obtaining function names will allow you to detect the failure to validate user input length (using copy_from_sockptr) and report the bug pattern efficiently.
