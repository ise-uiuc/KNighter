Your plan here

1. No customized program state is needed for this checker because the bug pattern is stateless. We simply need to detect calls to copy_from_sockptr that do not perform proper length validation.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept function call events.

3. In checkPreCall:
   • Identify the call by retrieving the callee’s identifier. If the identifier’s name equals "copy_from_sockptr", then you have a target call.
   • (Optionally) Further restrict the locations by checking if the surrounding function (using upward AST traversal) is either "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old" or "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt". This reduces false positives.
   • Retrieve the arguments of the call. Typically, copy_from_sockptr is called with three arguments: the destination pointer, the source pointer, and the copy size. Since the bug is caused by not checking that the provided optlen (from the caller’s parameters) is at least as big as the expected type’s size, note that the call does not verify the user-supplied length.
   • Because the patch replaces copy_from_sockptr with bt_copy_from_sockptr which accepts an additional length validation parameter, the presence of copy_from_sockptr in these sensitive functions is a clear indicator of the bug.

4. Report Bugs:
   • Generate a bug report (using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short, clear message such as "User input length not validated when copying data from user space."
   • Emit the bug report at this call site.

5. Summary:
   • No program state maps (e.g. for pointer aliasing) are required.
   • The only callback is checkPreCall.
   • The implementation outlines:
       1. In checkPreCall, check if Call.getCalleeIdentifier()->getName() equals "copy_from_sockptr".
       2. Optionally verify that the call appears in a function whose name is "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt" or "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old" (using upward AST traversal).
       3. When a match is found, immediately report the bug using a concise message.
       
This plan minimizes complexity while directly detecting the use of copy_from_sockptr without proper validation of the optlen parameter.
