Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program State Usage:
   • For this checker you do not need to introduce any new program state maps. The bug does not require alias tracking or taint propagation; it simply needs to verify that a call to copy_from_sockptr is made in a context where the user‐provided length (optlen) is not validated. We can perform this check by intercepting the call events.

------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Their Implementation Details:

A. Use checkPreCall:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept every function call.
   • Check whether the callee’s name is "copy_from_sockptr" by retrieving the identifier from Call.getCalleeIdentifier(). (Hint: You may compare its name using getNameAsString.)
   • Once you detect a call to copy_from_sockptr, use findSpecificTypeInParents to check that you are in the context of the functions “rfcomm_sock_setsockopt” or “rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old” (you can compare the parent function’s name to ensure you are in the target context).
   • Next, retrieve the call’s arguments. In these calls the third argument (index 2) is the size parameter used for copying. Use EvaluateExprToInt to try to obtain its constant value.
   • Although you could compare the constant (e.g. sizeof(u32) or computed via min_t) with an expected value, the essential check is that a fixed size constant is being used rather than validating against the optlen provided by the caller. In other words, if you see a call to copy_from_sockptr in these functions, assume that the proper validation (i.e. comparing optlen against the size to be copied) is missing.
   • If the call is detected, immediately report a bug with a short and clear message such as "User input length is not validated before copying"—this is the core of the issue.

B. Bug Reporting:
   • Use a bug reporter (e.g. create a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short message.
   • Generate a non‐fatal error node so that the analysis continues but the bug is flagged.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of Steps:

   1. In your checkPreCall callback, inspect all call events.
   2. For each CallEvent, if Call.getCalleeIdentifier() indicates the function is "copy_from_sockptr":
         a. (Optionally) use findSpecificTypeInParents to verify that the call is within "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt" or "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old".
         b. Retrieve the third argument and attempt to evaluate it as an integer using EvaluateExprToInt.
         c. Based on the fact that a constant size (and not a validated optlen) is being passed, emit a bug report.
   3. Use your reporting mechanism (std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport) to output the message "User input length is not validated before copying".

------------------------------------------------------------------
This plan uses a single callback (checkPreCall) and avoids extra state or pointer analysis. By focusing on detecting and reporting calls to copy_from_sockptr in the target functions, you can keep the implementation simple and effective.

Write your checker following this plan.
