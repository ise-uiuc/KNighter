Your plan here

1. Callback Selection  
 • Use checkPreCall to intercept every call event.  
 • (No program state customization is required for pointer or alias tracking, since the bug pattern centers on misuse of a specific function call.)  

2. Identify the Vulnerable Function  
 • In checkPreCall, retrieve the callee's identifier using Call.getCalleeIdentifier().  
 • Compare the function name with "copy_from_sockptr".  
 • (Ensure you do not trigger on calls to bt_copy_from_sockptr because those already validate the length.)  

3. Validate the Call Arguments  
 • Once a call to copy_from_sockptr is detected, obtain its three arguments:  
  – The destination pointer (first argument).  
  – The userspace source pointer (second argument).  
  – The fixed size (third argument).  
 • Optionally, use EvaluateExprToInt on the third argument to determine the expected copy size, which may be a constant such as sizeof(u32) or sizeof(sec).  
 • Note that the checker does not see any validation of the provided user length (optlen) because copy_from_sockptr does not use it.  

4. Report the Bug  
 • If a call to copy_from_sockptr is found (indicating the fixed-size copy is performed without using the user-supplied optlen), generate a bug report.  
 • Use a short, clear message such as "Unchecked user input length when copying from userspace".  
 • Create the bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) and emit it via the CheckerContext’s report mechanism.  

5. Final Consideration  
 • Keep the implementation simple: the checker only needs to flag calls to copy_from_sockptr since that function is the root cause of not validating the real length provided by the user.  
 • No additional state or pointer aliasing is necessary because the misuse is localized to this improper API invocation.
