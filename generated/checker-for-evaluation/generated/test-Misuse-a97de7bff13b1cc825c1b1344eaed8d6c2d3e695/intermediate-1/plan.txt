1. No custom program state maps are needed. We can perform all necessary checks within the call event callback without tracking pointer aliases or other state.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept every call event. In the callback, perform the following steps:
 a. Identify whether the callee’s name is "copy_from_sockptr". (Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare its name with "copy_from_sockptr".)
 b. Retrieve the call arguments. Determine the number of arguments passed. In legacy usage the function is called with three arguments (e.g. the destination pointer, the user pointer, and an explicit constant specifying the expected copy size) without any user-supplied length parameter.
 c. If exactly three arguments are present, this indicates that the function is used without validating the user input length (optlen). In that case, immediately generate a bug report with a short message—for example, "Unchecked copy_from_sockptr call: potential out-of-bounds read"—using generateNonFatalErrorNode and std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport).
 d. If the call contains four arguments (as in the corrected usage seen in the patch, where the expected size and the user-provided length are passed separately), evaluate:
  i. Use EvaluateExprToInt on the third argument to obtain the expected copy size.
  ii. Use EvaluateExprToInt or (if necessary) infer the value of the fourth (user length) argument.
 e. Compare the two values. If the expected copy size is greater than the evaluated user-provided optlen, issue a bug report with a clear message such as "User-supplied length insufficient for copy_from_sockptr" to warn about a potential memory overread.
 f. Finally, exit the callback if no issues are found.

3. Keep the bug report message short and clear while ensuring that the checker reports a warning only when the legacy copy function is detected without proper validation. 

This plan, using only the checkPreCall callback and argument evaluation provided by the utility functions (like EvaluateExprToInt), is simple and direct for detecting the target bug pattern.
