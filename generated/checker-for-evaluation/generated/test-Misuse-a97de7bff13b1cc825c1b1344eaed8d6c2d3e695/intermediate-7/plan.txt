Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide if you need to customize program states  
   • In this checker, you do not need to register any complex program state or alias maps.  
   • All the information needed comes from the function call event and its surrounding AST context.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose callback functions  
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept all function call events.  
   • In checkPreCall, match calls to the function "copy_from_sockptr".

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Steps in the Callback  
   a. In checkPreCall, first check if the callee identifier’s name equals "copy_from_sockptr".  
      • Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and then compare its name with "copy_from_sockptr".  
   b. Confirm the context by climbing the AST:  
      • Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to locate the FunctionDecl or Decl that encloses the call event; check that its name is either "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old" or "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt".  
      • (Optionally use getNameAsString() on the found function declaration to verify you are in the target socket option handler.)
   c. Analyze the call’s arguments:  
      • Check that the third argument (the size parameter in copy_from_sockptr) is a constant literal representing the expected size (use EvaluateExprToInt).  
      • Note that in the patched code this call is replaced by bt_copy_from_sockptr, so any instance of copy_from_sockptr in these functions is suspicious.
   d. (Optional) Attempt to locate a branch condition that verifies the user input length (optlen) against the expected size by using the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to see if a condition comparing optlen to the literal exists.  
      • To keep things simple, you can choose to report the issue whenever the call to copy_from_sockptr appears in the target function.
   e. Report the bug:  
      • Create a PathSensitiveBugReport (or BasicBugReport) with a short and clear message like "Unchecked user-provided length in copy_from_sockptr" and then emit it.  
      • Use the BugReporter through CheckerContext’s emitReport mechanism.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary of the implementation  
   • In checkPreCall, intercept all call events.  
   • If the callee is "copy_from_sockptr" and it resides in a socket option handler function such as "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt" or its "_old" variant, then this indicates that the user-provided optlen is not being validated before copying.  
   • Issue a bug report stating the potential for out-of-bound memory access due to unchecked user input length.  

------------------------------------------------------------
By following this plan—with minimal steps and using the provided utility functions—you will have a simple yet effective CSA checker to detect incorrect user input validation when copying from user-space in these socket option handlers.
