1. Decide on Program States:  
 • No custom program state maps are necessary for this checker. Our goal is solely to verify that before a call to copy_from_sockptr the user‐supplied length (optlen) is checked against the expected copy size.  
 • We do not need to track pointer aliases for this bug pattern.

2. Choose Callback Functions:  
 a. checkPreCall:  
  • In this callback, intercept every call event.  
  • When the call’s callee name is "copy_from_sockptr", then do the following:  
   – Retrieve the call arguments. In particular, extract the third argument which specifies the number of bytes to copy.  
   – Use EvaluateExprToInt to try to determine a constant “expected size” for the copy (for example, if it is “sizeof(u32)” or “sizeof(sec)”).  
   – Then, attempt to locate (via upward AST traversal or by examining the call’s surrounding context) if a branch condition exists that validates the optlen parameter. You can use the provided utility ExprHasName to check if the surrounding IfStmt’s condition involves the string "optlen" (or a related macro value) and a comparison with the expected size.  
   – If no such condition exists – that is, if the checker cannot detect that user input length (optlen) is compared with or validated against the expected size – then report a bug.  
   – To report the bug, generate a non-fatal error node and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a short clear message (for example: "User buffer length not validated").

 b. checkBranchCondition (optional):  
  • Optionally, you can hook branch conditions to track if optlen is validated.  
  • In the checkBranchCondition callback, inspect conditions of IfStmts.  
   – Use the provided utility, such as ExprHasName, to see if the condition includes a comparison (e.g., optlen >= expected_size).  
   – If the branch condition correctly checks optlen, then record that the surrounding code has performed appropriate validation. This could be recorded in a state flag so that when the copy_from_sockptr call is eventually reached, the checker can determine that no bug should be reported.

3. Implementation Details per Step:  
 • In checkPreCall, start by checking if Call.getCalleeIdentifier()->getName() equals "copy_from_sockptr".  
 • Extract the third argument from Call and use EvaluateExprToInt to obtain the expected copy size.  
 • Use findSpecificTypeInParents (or simple AST traversal) to identify an enclosing IfStmt. In that IfStmt, examine its condition using ExprHasName to determine if it contains "optlen" and a comparison operator (e.g., ">=" or "==") with the expected size constant.  
 • If no such condition is found (or if the condition does not perform the needed check), immediately report a bug using a short message such as "User buffer length not validated".  
 • Optionally, in checkBranchCondition, if a condition validating optlen is detected, you might mark a state flag so that later calls to copy_from_sockptr in the same function are not reported erroneously.

4. Summary of the Checker Flow:  
 • No extra program state mappings are needed (beyond the AST/context provided by CheckerContext).  
 • Use checkPreCall as the main entry point to examine calls to copy_from_sockptr.  
 • Analyze the expected copy size (third argument) and attempt to verify that the optlen parameter in the surrounding function is being conditionally checked (using checkBranchCondition or upward AST traversal).  
 • Report a bug if the checker finds that the user-supplied buffer length is not appropriately validated before the copy operation.

This plan lays out a simple, step-by-step approach to write the checker targeting the bug pattern of not validating the user-supplied buffer length before copying from user space.
