1. Decide on the Program State Maps:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ResetCheckedMap, const MemRegion*, bool): Use this map to remember for each reset_data pointer whether its completion notification has been checked (i.e. via a completion_done() call).
   • Optionally, REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*): Use this to track aliasing relationships so that if one pointer is marked as “checked” its aliases are also flagged.

2. In checkBranchCondition:
   • For every if-statement encountered, inspect the condition expression.
   • Use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the textual source of the condition contains "completion_done".
   • If the condition is meant to check the completion status, then:
       – Use findSpecificTypeInChildren or similar to extract the completion_done() call.
       – Identify the pointer argument (typically reset_data->compl) and then, by walking upward using findSpecificTypeInParents (which can locate the container_of call), determine the base reset_data pointer’s MemRegion.
       – Update the ResetCheckedMap in the Program State to mark that region as “checked” (set to true).

3. In checkPreCall:
   • Intercept calls to the memory deallocation function (e.g. kfree) by checking the CallEvent’s callee name.
   • For each kfree call, use getMemRegionFromExpr on the argument to extract the MemRegion corresponding to reset_data.
   • Look up this region (or its aliases via PtrAliasMap if implemented) in ResetCheckedMap.
   • If the region is not found or isn’t marked as “checked” (i.e. completion_done was not verified), then issue a bug report with a short message (e.g. “Race: free without completion_done check”) using generateNonFatalErrorNode or by creating a PathSensitiveBugReport.

4. In checkBind (Optional Pointer Alias Tracking):
   • When a pointer (e.g. the result of container_of(reset_data->compl)) is assigned to another variable, use checkBind to update PtrAliasMap.
   • If the source pointer is marked as “checked” in ResetCheckedMap, then propagate that marking to the destination.
   • This ensures that any alias of the reset_data pointer will be recognized as having been conditioned on a completion_done check.

This simple four‐step plan (with an optional aliasing step) ensures that every freeing of reset_data (via kfree) is preceded by a branch condition that calls completion_done() (or checks its result). Following these concrete instructions will allow you to write a checker that detects the race condition in which reset_data is freed concurrently without properly verifying its usage status.
