1. Customize program state:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will record the “freed” status of the reset_data structure.
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
     – This map will track alias relationships for the reset_data pointer.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • checkPostCall:
     – Intercept calls to memory‐freeing functions (e.g. “kfree”).
     – In checkPostCall, if the callee’s name is “kfree”, extract its argument and retrieve its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
     – Use the PtrAliasMap to resolve the canonical region if the pointer is an alias.
     – Consult the FreedStateMap: if the region is already marked as freed, generate a bug report with a short message such as “Race condition: reset_data double free detected.”
     – Otherwise, update the FreedStateMap to mark the region as freed.
     
   • checkBranchCondition:
     – Hook conditions that involve completion_done(&reset_data->compl).
     – Examine the BranchCondition statement and use a helper (e.g. ExprHasName) to check if the condition contains “completion_done”.
     – If the condition is found, then update the program state: mark this reset_data pointer (found via getMemRegionFromExpr on the argument of completion_done) as “safe to free” (or note that freeing in this branch is synchronized). Optionally, record that the pointer has been checked so that a later call to “kfree” that comes from the same branch does not trigger a warning.
     
   • checkBind:
     – Use checkBind to propagate aliasing: when a pointer is assigned from reset_data to another variable, record the alias relationship in PtrAliasMap.
     – This ensures that if one alias is later marked freed or checked via completion_done, all aliases are updated in FreedStateMap accordingly.

3. Implementation details:
   • In checkPostCall:
     - First, determine the callee’s name. If it equals “kfree”, retrieve its first argument.
     - Use getMemRegionFromExpr to obtain the region of the pointer.
     - Resolve any alias using PtrAliasMap.
     - If FreedStateMap indicates that the region is already freed, then call C.emitReport with a short bug report “Race condition: reset_data double free detected.”
     - Otherwise, mark the region as freed in FreedStateMap.
     
   • In checkBranchCondition:
     - Analyze the condition expression to see if it calls “completion_done”. You can use ExprHasName for the “completion_done” string.
     - If found, get the pointer argument (e.g. reset_data’s compl field), then retrieve its containing region.
     - In the program state, update the FreedStateMap for that region (and its aliases) to denote that freeing is being controlled.
     
   • In checkBind:
     - When one pointer is bound to another, fetch the MemRegion of both the source and target. Update PtrAliasMap so that later checks in checkPostCall and checkBranchCondition find the canonical region.
     
4. Bug reporting:
   • When a violating free is detected (i.e. the region is already marked freed and a new kfree call on it occurs, or if the free is performed in a branch that does not check completion_done when it should), generate a bug report using either std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>.
   • The bug message should be succinct (for example, “Race condition: reset_data free race detected.”).

This simple plan hooks the free calls (via checkPostCall) and the branch condition (via checkBranchCondition) while propagating pointer aliases (via checkBind) to catch unsynchronized or double-free paths on the shared reset_data structure.
