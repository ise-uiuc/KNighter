Your plan here

1. Customize Program State:
   • Register a program state map to track whether a reset_data object has been freed. For example, use
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ResetDataFreedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     which will map a memory region (from a reset_data pointer) to a Boolean flag (false initially meaning “not freed” and true once freed).

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   A. checkPreCall (to intercept freeing calls)
      • In checkPreCall, check for function calls whose callee identifier is "kfree".
      • Retrieve the call’s first argument and use the utility function getMemRegionFromExpr() to obtain its MemRegion.
      • Use the provided ExprHasName() function to check if the argument’s source text contains "reset_data" – this will help ensure that only free calls targeting the reset_data object are examined.
      • Consult the ResetDataFreedMap using the region you obtained:
          – If the map indicates that the region has already been freed (flag is true), then generate a bug report (using a simple message like "Double free of reset_data detected").
          – If the region is not yet marked as freed (or is absent from the map), update the program state and mark this region as freed (set the flag to true).

   B. checkBind (for pointer alias tracking – optional but recommended for soundness)
      • In checkBind, when a pointer is copied (for example, assigning reset_data to another variable), record the aliasing information.
      • Register another map (e.g., PtrAliasMap) to map one reset_data MemRegion to its alias.
      • When updating the ResetDataFreedMap in checkPreCall, also propagate the “freed” flag to all aliases in the PtrAliasMap.
      • This ensures that if a reset_data object has been freed via one alias, a subsequent free through any other alias will be flagged.

3. Detailed Implementation Steps:
   Step 1 – Registration:
      • At checker initialization, register ResetDataFreedMap. Also (if desired) register PtrAliasMap with the appropriate type (const MemRegion* mapped to const MemRegion*), so that when a reset_data pointer is bound to another, the alias relationship is maintained.

   Step 2 – Intercepting kfree calls in checkPreCall:
      • For every call event, if the callee’s name equals "kfree":
          1. Retrieve the argument expression.
          2. Use ExprHasName to check that the text of this expression contains "reset_data". (This simple string check limits the checker to the desired bug pattern.)
          3. Get its associated memory region through getMemRegionFromExpr.
          4. Look up this region (or any of its aliases via PtrAliasMap) in ResetDataFreedMap:
             – If found and marked as freed (true), then create and emit a bug report that clearly states “Double free of reset_data detected.”
             – Otherwise, update the ResetDataFreedMap by associating the region (and all its aliases) with true.
      • This simple approach allows the checker to catch the race condition where the same reset_data structure is freed twice.

   Step 3 – Propagating the state via checkBind:
      • In checkBind, whenever a pointer is stored into another, determine if the pointer’s source expression contains "reset_data" (using ExprHasName).
      • If it does, update the PtrAliasMap with an alias mapping from the LHS region to the original reset_data region.
      • Then, when checkPreCall updates the freed flag, also update the aliases in the PtrAliasMap.
      • This ensures that even if reset_data is freed via a variable alias, the checker will correctly flag a second free from any such alias.

4. Bug Reporting:
   • When a double free is detected (i.e., ResetDataFreedMap already has the region marked as freed), use a simple bug report that is short and clear. For instance, use:
        std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>("Double free of reset_data detected", ...) 
     to generate the report.

Following this plan, your checker will intercept kfree calls that aim to free reset_data, track whether the memory has already been freed via a program state map (and optional aliasing map), and report a potential race condition if a double free occurs.
