1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • Register a program state map (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) to track the “reset_data” structure. For example, create a map called FreedResetDataMap indexed by the reset_data’s memory region (const MemRegion*) and holding a boolean value to indicate whether the structure has already been freed.

2. Choose callback functions and implement the checker:

   A. Use checkBind:
      • In checkBind, watch for the assignment where “reset_data” is computed via container_of (i.e. when the work structure is being converted to a pointer to adf_reset_dev_data). 
      • Retrieve the memory region from the corresponding expression (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and add an entry to FreedResetDataMap with value false (i.e. not freed yet). This establishes our baseline to track the pointer through its lifetime.

   B. Use checkPreCall:
      • Intercept calls to the free functions (e.g. kfree) in both adf_device_reset_worker and adf_dev_aer_schedule_reset.
      • For each free call, extract the expression for the pointer argument and obtain its MemRegion.
      • Consult FreedResetDataMap:
            – If the region is not marked as freed, update its flag to true.
            – If it is already marked as freed, emit a bug report by creating a short, clear PathSensitiveBugReport indicating a potential double free (i.e. race condition) of reset_data.
      • This step ensures that if the reset_data structure is freed in one code path and later a duplicate free is attempted, the checker will flag it.

   C. Use checkBranchCondition (optional):
      • In checkBranchCondition, hook any “if” statement that uses a condition involving completion_done (for instance, examining an expression whose source text (using ExprHasName) contains “completion_done”).
      • Although this is not strictly required to track the state, you may use it to log or further refine the analysis of the branch that leads to freeing reset_data. This extra scrutiny can help confirm that one branch (e.g. reset_data->mode == ADF_DEV_RESET_ASYNC || completion_done(&reset_data->compl)) has a side effect of freeing reset_data. When this condition is detected, you can also update the program state accordingly. However, if you choose this approach, make sure that the update is aligned with the update performed in checkPreCall so that no branch conflicts are missed.

3. Bug Reporting:
   • When a duplicate call to kfree is detected (i.e. the region is already marked as freed in FreedResetDataMap), create a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short message such as “Double free of reset_data possible.”
   • Emit the bug report via the CheckerContext (e.g. C.emitReport(...)).

This plan uses minimal steps:
– A program state map to monitor a key pointer,
– checkBind to initialize tracking of the reset_data structure,
– checkPreCall to observe calls to kfree and update/check the state,
– Optionally, checkBranchCondition to recognize and record the branch condition involving completion_done.
Following this plan should let you catch scenarios where reset_data is freed twice because the condition checking (including completion_done) is not properly gating the free call, thus exposing the race condition in the driver code.
