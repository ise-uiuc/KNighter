1. Decide on Program State Maps:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ResetDataStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool):
     – This map tracks whether a given reset_data region has been freed. Initially, assign “false” (not freed) when the reset_data is first encountered.
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*):
     – This map tracks alias relationships; when a reset_data pointer is bound to another pointer, record the relation so that any change in its state is propagated.

2. Choose Callback Functions and Implement Steps:
   • checkPostCall (for call events):
     – Intercept call events to memory free functions (e.g., kfree).
     – Retrieve the argument passed to kfree. Use getMemRegionFromExpr to obtain its region.
     – Look up the region in ResetDataStateMap. If the map indicates the region is already freed (true), then emit a bug report (e.g., “ResetData race: double free detected”).
     – Otherwise, update the map to mark the region as freed (set the associated value to true).
   • checkBind (for pointer aliasing):
     – Intercept pointer assignments where the reset_data pointer is stored in another variable.
     – Record aliasing information in PtrAliasMap so that if any alias is later freed, the other aliases are known as well.
     – Do not alter the ResetDataStateMap here; simply maintain the aliasing relationship.
   • checkBranchCondition (for completion_done condition):
     – Intercept branch conditions that call completion_done using the completion_done() function.
     – If the completion_done() call is found checking the reset_data’s completion field, use this as an indication that the scheduler is verifying if the caller timed out.
     – Although the main focus is on detecting free races, optionally note that if completion_done is evaluated, the reset_data pointer should be handled differently.
  
3. Reporting:
   • When a double free is detected (via ResetDataStateMap already true at a new free call), use a simple bug report mechanism (e.g., std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short message.
   • Ensure the bug report includes the essential information (“ResetData race: reset_data structure is freed in multiple contexts”) without extra verbosity.

This plan provides a simple, concrete approach using minimal steps and the provided utility functions to track the lifecycle of the reset_data container and detect the race condition.
