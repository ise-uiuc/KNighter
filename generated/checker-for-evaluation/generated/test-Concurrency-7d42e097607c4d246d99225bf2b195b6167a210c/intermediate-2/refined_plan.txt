Your plan should follow these steps:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program States

• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ResetDataCheckedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
  – This map will associate the memory region of a reset_data structure with a boolean flag that marks if its completion object was already “checked” by calling completion_done().

• (Optionally) REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
  – Use this for alias tracking if pointers to reset_data are assigned to other variables.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Implementation Details

A. Use checkBranchCondition

• In checkBranchCondition, look for branches that contain a call to completion_done().
  – When a branch’s condition contains a call like completion_done(&reset_data->compl), extract the reset_data pointer (using downward AST traversal via findSpecificTypeInChildren or direct matching on the argument expression).
  – Once identified, update ResetDataCheckedMap for the corresponding reset_data region to true (marking that the caller has verified completion status).
  – This ensures that if the branch has a condition check for completion_done, the state is tracked.

B. Use checkPreCall for calls to free functions

• In checkPreCall, intercept calls to kfree() (or any other deallocation function relevant to reset_data).
  – Retrieve the argument pointer of kfree() and obtain its memory region (using getMemRegionFromExpr).
  – Use the program state (ResetDataCheckedMap) to check if the reset_data region was already “checked” (i.e. completion_done was invoked) or not.
  – If the region is not marked as checked and the same reset_data region is freed in two different execution paths, report a bug with a short message (e.g. “Race: reset_data freed without proper completion check”).
  – Optionally, use PtrAliasMap in checkBind to add aliasing information if the reset_data pointer is propagated to other variables.

C. (Optional) Use checkBind

• In checkBind, when a reset_data pointer is assigned (e.g. reset_data gets stored into another variable), update the PtrAliasMap accordingly.
  – This ensures that if one pointer’s completion check is performed, all its aliases are known and considered checked.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Bug Reporting

• When a potential race condition is detected (i.e. the check in checkPreCall finds that the reset_data region is being freed while its ResetDataCheckedMap flag is false or ambiguous), generate a bug report.
  – Create a report with a brief, clear message like “Race condition: possible use-after-free on reset_data.”
  – Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to construct the report.

------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Method Summary

• When the worker thread routine is analyzed, the checker will:
  – Record the reset_data’s region into ResetDataCheckedMap as unchecked by default upon creation.
  – In checkBranchCondition, look for a condition using completion_done(&reset_data->compl) and mark the corresponding region as “checked.”
  – In checkPreCall, intercept kfree() calls that free reset_data. Then, look up in ResetDataCheckedMap.
    – If the memory is being freed without evidence of a proper completion check, then flag a potential use-after-free condition due to race conditions.
• Alias tracking (via PtrAliasMap) is maintained during pointer assignments in checkBind, ensuring that if any alias is checked, the whole set is marked correctly.

Following these steps will allow you to write a CSA checker that specifically detects the bug pattern where unsynchronized free() calls on reset_data lead to a race condition use-after-free bug.
