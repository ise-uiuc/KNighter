1. REGISTER PROGRAM STATE MAP
   • Define a program state map (e.g. CompletionCheckedMap) to track whether the completion has been checked for a given reset_data allocation. Use:
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(CompletionCheckedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
   • This map will record, for each reset_data memory region, whether a completion_done() check has been performed (true) or not (false).

2. CHOOSE CALLBACK FUNCTIONS
   • Hook checkPreCall for call events.
   • Optionally, hook checkBind to track pointer aliasing if the reset_data pointer can be propagated under different names.

3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

   A. In checkPreCall – Hooking the completion_done call:
      • When a call event is intercepted, check if the callee name is "completion_done".
      • Use the provided utility getMemRegionFromExpr() on the call’s argument (i.e. the pointer to the completion in the reset_data structure).
      • Optionally, if the argument points to a subfield (reset_data->compl), use findSpecificTypeInParents to walk up to the reset_data structure’s region.
      • Update the program state for the obtained region: mark it as checked (true) in CompletionCheckedMap.
      • This ensures that whenever completion_done() is called for a reset_data’s completion, its corresponding entry in the state is updated.

   B. In checkPreCall – Hooking the kfree call:
      • In the same checkPreCall callback, check for calls named "kfree".
      • Use getMemRegionFromExpr() on the kfree() argument to retrieve the memory region corresponding to the reset_data structure.
      • Consult the CompletionCheckedMap for that region.
           – If an entry exists and indicates the completion has been checked (true), then the memory is freed appropriately.
           – If not (entry missing or false), then the checker should report a bug. The report message must be short and clear (e.g. "Race condition: reset_data freed without completion check").
      • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport to generate the bug report.

   C. (Optional) In checkBind – Tracking aliasing:
      • When a reset_data pointer is bound to another pointer variable, use checkBind to update a PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) so that the completion check status propagates.
      • This is useful if the reset_data pointer is assigned or passed to other functions before being freed.
      • Ensure that when a pointer becomes checked (via completion_done), the state for all aliased regions is updated.

4. FINAL LOGIC
   • With these callbacks, the checker will be able to detect if a reset_data allocation is freed via kfree() in a context where no completion_done() check was performed.
   • This correctly identifies the race condition where the shared data structure is freed prematurely.
   • Keep the implementation simple: only intercept the relevant function calls (completion_done and kfree) and update or check the program state accordingly.

This concise and concrete plan should let you write a checker that flags the race condition described in the target patch.
