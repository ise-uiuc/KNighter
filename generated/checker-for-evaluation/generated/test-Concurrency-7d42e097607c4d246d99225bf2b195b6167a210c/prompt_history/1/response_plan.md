1. Customize Program States:
   • Register a program state map (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ResetDataMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) to track the freed status of reset_data. The bool will be false when reset_data is allocated (not freed) and set to true when it is freed.
   • Optionally, register a pointer alias map (PtrAliasMap) to track alias relationships for reset_data pointers from container_of or subsequently bound pointers.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • checkPostCall:
     – In checkPostCall, intercept the call that creates reset_data via container_of.
     – Retrieve the memory region corresponding to reset_data and initialize its entry in ResetDataMap to false (indicating it has not been freed yet).
   • checkBranchCondition:
     – In checkBranchCondition, examine branch conditions that invoke completion_done with reset_data’s completion member.
     – Use the provided utility function ExprHasName to check if the condition expression contains “completion_done”.
     – When a branch condition uses completion_done and evaluates to true (when the caller has timed out and the completion is done), mark the corresponding reset_data region as “freed” in ResetDataMap. This reflects that the scheduling function should free reset_data.
   • checkPreCall (or checkPostCall if preferred):
     – In checkPreCall, intercept calls to kfree. Identify if the argument passed to kfree corresponds to a reset_data pointer (using getMemRegionFromExpr or similar methods).
     – Consult the ResetDataMap for that memory region. If it is already marked as freed (true) and a kfree is attempted again, emit a bug report with a short, clear message (e.g. “Race condition: reset_data double free detected”).
     – Otherwise, update the ResetDataMap to mark the region as freed so that subsequent frees can be detected.
   • checkBind:
     – In checkBind, when a reset_data pointer is assigned to another, update the PtrAliasMap so that all aliases point to the same reset_data region.
     – Ensure that when marking reset_data as freed (or checking its state), all aliases are considered by consulting the alias map.

3. Bug Reporting:
   • When detecting a duplicate free (i.e. an attempt to free a reset_data whose ResetDataMap entry is already true), generate a non-fatal error node.
   • Create a bug report with a clear, short message along the lines of “Use-after-free due to race condition in reset_data handling” using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

By following these steps in the respective callbacks, you will be able to track the reset_data’s lifecycle, detect when it is freed in one branch (via completion_done) and then again in another, and reliably report the race that leads to use‐after‐free.
