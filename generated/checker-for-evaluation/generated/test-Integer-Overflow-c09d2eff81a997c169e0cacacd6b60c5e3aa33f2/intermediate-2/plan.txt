Your plan should be simple and focused on detecting a multiplication operation between 32-bit values whose product is later stored in a 64-bit variable. Here’s how to approach it:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Do You Need Custom Program States?  
--------------------------------------------------
• No custom program states or maps are required in this case since you are not tracking pointer aliases or taint information. Simply sanitize the AST nodes during assignment (bind) to check for the error pattern.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions  
--------------------------------------------------
• Use the checkBind callback to intercept assignments (bindings) of a computed value to a variable.
  
--------------------------------------------------
3. Detailed Steps in the Callback Implementation

Step 1: In checkBind, inspect the assignment whenever a value is bound (i.e. when a multiplication result is assigned to a variable).  
  - Retrieve the type of the target LValue to see whether it is a 64-bit type (for example, if its type is "u64" or an equivalent 64-bit unsigned integer).  
  - You can do this by using the AST node information of the target’s declaration.

Step 2: Analyze the expression being bound (RHS).  
  - Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator>(S) to search downward from the current statement for a BinaryOperator node.  
  - Verify that the operator is multiplication (check if its opcode is BO_Mul).

Step 3: Check the operands of the multiplication expression.  
  - For both operands, use the AST information (e.g. getType()) to verify that they are 32-bit unsigned integers.  
  - Optionally, you can use EvaluateExprToInt or directly compare the type’s bit width extracted from the AST context if needed.

Step 4: Verify the absence of explicit casting.  
  - If either operand is casted to a 64-bit type (e.g., by using an explicit cast in the AST), then the check should not report a bug.  
  - So ensure that both operands are not under a cast to a 64-bit type. You can search upward in the AST if necessary to see if the BinaryOperator node is immediately inside a cast expression.

Step 5: Report the bug  
  - If the binary multiplication between two 32-bit unsigned integers is found to be assigned to a 64-bit variable without a casting promotion, generate a bug report.  
  - Use a clear, short message (e.g., "Unintentional integer overflow: multiplication in 32-bit arithmetic assigned to 64-bit variable").

--------------------------------------------------
4. Summary of Implementation  
--------------------------------------------------
• In checkBind:  
  - Get the lvalue’s type. If it is a 64-bit integer, then:  
    - Use findSpecificTypeInChildren to locate a BinaryOperator node that represents a multiplication on the RHS.  
    - Confirm both operands are 32-bit unsigned ints and that no cast to 64-bit is present.
    - If confirmed, call generateNonFatalErrorNode and emit the bug report with a concise message.

Following this plan, you will correctly detect when a 32-bit multiplication result overflows due to the lack of type promotion before storing it in a 64-bit variable.
