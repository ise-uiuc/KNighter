## Bug Pattern

Multiplication of two 32-bit unsigned values, where the product is intended to be stored in a 64-bit variable, is performed using 32-bit arithmetic. This leads to an unintentional integer overflow before the result is assigned to a wider type. Casting one operand to 64-bit prior to multiplication is needed to ensure the arithmetic is performed correctly using 64-bit precision.
