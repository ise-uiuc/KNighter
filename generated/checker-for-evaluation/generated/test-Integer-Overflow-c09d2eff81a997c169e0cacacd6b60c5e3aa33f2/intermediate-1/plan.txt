1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states  
   • In this case no extra program state is needed. We do not need to track aliases or taint symbols because the bug is entirely about an arithmetic expression’s type conversion.  
   
2. Choose the callback functions  
   • Use checkPreStmt to visit BinaryOperator expressions.  
   • Optionally use findSpecificTypeInParents (our utility function) to go upward in the AST from the multiplication expression.

3. Implementation steps in checkPreStmt  
   • In checkPreStmt, inspect each BinaryOperator node that represents a multiplication (i.e. check if the operator is '*').  
   • Check that both operands (or at least one) are of the 32-bit unsigned integer type. Verify that the multiplication expression’s type is also 32-bit.  
   • Use findSpecificTypeInParents to search for an enclosing ImplicitCastExpr. Check if there is an explicit cast to a 64-bit type (for example, if one or both operands are cast to uint64_t, thus forcing 64-bit arithmetic). If such a cast is found, do nothing.  
   • Otherwise, search upward (using findSpecificTypeInParents) to identify if the result of the multiplication is being stored (or assigned) to a variable.  
       – If a parent assignment (or initialization) is found, retrieve the type of the left-hand side.  
       – If the variable’s type is 64-bit unsigned, then the multiplication result is first computed in 32-bit arithmetic and then assigned; this is the target bug pattern.  
   • Report a bug warning with a short and clear message such as “Multiplication performed in 32-bit arithmetic may overflow when stored into a 64-bit variable. Use a cast to 64-bit.”

4. Detailed design aspects  
   • The checkPreStmt callback makes it easier since it can catch the multiplication expression before it is cast or assigned.  
   • Use utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to climb the AST and find any ImplicitCastExpr or assignment operator wrapping the multiplication expression (thus identifying the intended destination type).  
   • Directly compare the AST types of the multiplication expression and the destination assignment.  
   • Do not attempt complex pointer or state modeling; simply check the arithmetic computation’s type and its context to determine if a cast is missing.

This concise plan should let you write a checker that finds cases where a multiplication between 32-bit unsigned integers is performed and later stored in a 64-bit variable without performing the multiplication in 64-bit arithmetic.
