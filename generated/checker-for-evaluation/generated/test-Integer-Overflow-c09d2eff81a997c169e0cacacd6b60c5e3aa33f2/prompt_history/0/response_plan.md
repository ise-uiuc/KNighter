1. Decide on Program States:  
   • No custom program state (e.g., new REGISTER_MAP) is needed for this checker because no pointer‐aliasing or tainting tracking is required.  
   
2. Choose the Callback Function:  
   • Use the checkBind callback. This callback is triggered when a value is bound to a variable. It is ideal for intercepting assignments such as storing the result of an arithmetic expression into a variable.  

3. Implement checkBind Callback:  
   • In checkBind, first check if the location being bound to corresponds to a variable of a 64-bit integer type (for example, “u64” in the driver).  
   • Next, inspect the right-hand side (RHS) expression. Look for a BinaryOperator representing multiplication (“*”).  
   • Once a multiplication operation is detected, retrieve the LHS and RHS operands of this multiplication.  
   • Determine the types of both operands. If both operands are of 32-bit unsigned integer type, then you have a potential problematic multiplication.  
   • Additionally, check the multiplication expression to see if there is an explicit type cast at either operand’s level so that at least one operand is promoted to 64-bit (using a CastExpr). You can use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren if needed to search for a cast in the subtree of the multiplication expression.  
   • If no cast is found, then the multiplication itself is performed in 32-bit arithmetic, leading to a potential overflow when the result is assigned to a 64-bit variable.  
   
4. Bug Reporting:  
   • If the above conditions are met, report the bug by creating a bug report with a short message such as “Potential integer overflow in 32-bit multiplication assigned to u64”.  
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>), and emit the report.  

5. Concluding Notes:  
   • This simple checker leverages type checking at the binding site (using checkBind) and examines the structure of the arithmetic expression.  
   • Remember to check both direct assignments in a function’s body and potential indirect cases (e.g., via helper functions) as needed.  

Following these concrete steps will allow you to implement an effective checker that catches multiplication operations where a cast to 64-bit is missing before assigning to a 64-bit variable.
