Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No custom program state maps are required because you are not tracking pointer aliases or similar state information. You only need to inspect expressions locally.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   • Use the checkBind callback. This callback is invoked when a value is being assigned (or bound) to a variable. You can inspect assignments in this callback.

3. Inspecting the Assignment:
   • In checkBind, first check whether the destination (the l-value) is a 64-bit integer type. For example, in the target bug the variable “mall_size” is 64-bit.
   • Use the AST API to determine the type of the l-value. (Hint: check the QualType of the declaration the l-value refers to.)

4. Detecting the Multiplication Expression:
   • Inspect the bound value – the expression being assigned.
   • Use the helper function findSpecificTypeInChildren templated with BinaryOperator to search within the expression tree for a multiplication operator (“*”).
   • If no multiplication operator is found, then ignore this binding.

5. Verifying Operand Types:
   • Once you identify a BinaryOperator with the “*” operator, extract its two operands.
   • Check the type of each operand. The bug pattern is triggered when both operands are 32-bit unsigned integers.
   • (Use type introspection functions on the AST nodes to retrieve the integer width and signedness.)

6. Checking for Type Promotion:
   • Examine if at least one of the operands is explicitly cast to a 64-bit type before the multiplication operation.
   • You can search for any CastExpr in the subtree of the multiplication expression using findSpecificTypeInChildren templated with CastExpr.
   • If an explicit cast to 64-bit is found on one operand, then the multiplication is safe. Otherwise, it is potentially problematic.

7. Reporting the Bug:
   • If you confirm that the multiplication is performed with both operands as 32-bit values (and no cast promoting one of them to 64-bit) but the result is being assigned to a 64-bit variable, then create a bug report.
   • Use a short and clear message, for example: "Potential integer overflow: multiplication of 32-bit values assigned to a 64-bit variable."
   • Report the bug using the standard bug reporting mechanism (e.g., std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>).

------------------------------------------------------------
Following this plan step by step in your checkBind callback will allow you to detect the intended bug pattern in a straightforward manner.
