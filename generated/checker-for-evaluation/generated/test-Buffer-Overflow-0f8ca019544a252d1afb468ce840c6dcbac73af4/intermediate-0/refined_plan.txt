1. Customize a simple program state flag:
   • REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(BoundsChecked, bool)
   • This flag will be used to record whether a bounds-check against the macro __DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__ has been performed in the current function.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • checkBeginFunction:
     – In this callback, reset the BoundsChecked state to false when a new function is being analyzed.
     – Optionally, check if the current function’s name is "map_hw_resources" (or matches the containing file’s context) to restrict our analysis.

   • checkBranchCondition:
     – For every branch “if” condition, use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the condition expression’s source text contains "__DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__".
     – If found, update the program state by marking BoundsChecked as true. This indicates that a bounds-check is present and that the subsequent array index uses in this region are safe.

   • checkPreStmt:
     – For every statement, check if it is an ArraySubscriptExpr (i.e. an access into an array).
     – Use findSpecificTypeInChildren (or dynamic casting) to determine if the subscript’s base expression involves one of the destination arrays – for example, check whether the source text contains "dml_pipe_idx_to_stream_id" or "dml_pipe_idx_to_plane_id". You may use ExprHasName for this purpose.
     – If such an array access is detected and the program state DOES NOT indicate a BoundsChecked flag, report a potential bug.
     – Use a short and clear message (for example: "Unchecked array index may cause a buffer overflow.") and emit a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>).

3. Implementation summary (step-by-step):
   • In checkBeginFunction, initialize BoundsChecked to false.
   • In checkBranchCondition, for every if-statement condition, invoke ExprHasName on the condition. If "__DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__" is present, update the BoundsChecked flag in the program state.
   • In checkPreStmt, when the statement is an ArraySubscriptExpr accessing one of the suspicious destination arrays, query the program state. If BoundsChecked is still false, then generate a warning indicating a potential buffer overflow due to unchecked array index.
   • No pointer tracking or aliasing state maps are necessary for this checker as the analysis is localized to index checking.

By following these clear and concise steps, you can implement the CSA checker to warn about using an array index without an explicit bounds check.
