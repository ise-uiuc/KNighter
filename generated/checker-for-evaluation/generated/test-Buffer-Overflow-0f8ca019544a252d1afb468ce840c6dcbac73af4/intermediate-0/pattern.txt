## Bug Pattern

Using an array index without validating that it is within the bounds of the destination array. In this case, the code copies data into arrays using the index "i" from one array (disp_cfg_to_stream_id and disp_cfg_to_plane_id) without checking that "i" is less than the maximum allowed number of streams/planes, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
