Your plan here

1. It is not necessary to customize the program state for this bug pattern. We only need to inspect function calls and analyze the allocation argument.

2. Use the checkPostCall callback to intercept allocation calls because we want to analyze the arguments after the call is built.

3. In checkPostCall, implement the following steps:
   • Identify if the current call is to the allocation function "kzalloc". You can do this by inspecting Call.getCalleeIdentifier()’s name.
   • When a "kzalloc" call is detected, retrieve its first argument—which represents the allocation size.
   • Use an AST utility approach (for example, with findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator>) to check if this allocation size argument is expressed as a multiplication operation. This should detect an expression of the form "sizeof(type) * count".
   • Optionally, use EvaluateExprToInt to attempt getting integer values from the subexpressions. However, even if you cannot fully evaluate them, you only need to recognize the multiplication pattern.
   • If a multiplication operation is found, report a bug with a short message (e.g., "Multiplication in allocation can overflow") using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport).

4. The report message must be short and clear. The bug report should indicate that performing multiplication directly in allocation without checking for overflow is the potential bug.

5. No pointer alias tracking or program state map is needed for this rule.

Following these concrete steps in checkPostCall will allow you to easily detect the target bug pattern.
