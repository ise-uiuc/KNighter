Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program State Customization  
 • In this checker no new program state maps are required. You only need to detect the suspicious allocation at the call site.  

2. Choose Callback Functions  
 • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept allocation calls.  
 • You do not need checkBind, checkBranchCondition, or similar pointer-tracking functions.

3. Implementation Steps in checkPreCall  
 a. When checkPreCall is invoked, obtain the CallEvent object.  
 b. Check if the callee identifier is "kzalloc".  
  - Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() to extract the function name.  
  - Compare the function name with "kzalloc".  
 c. If the call is to kzalloc, retrieve its first argument (the allocation size).  
  - Use Call.getArg(0) to access the size argument.  
 d. Analyze the allocation size expression:  
  - Walk the AST of the first argument and use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator>() to check if the expression contains a multiplication operator.  
  - If the multiplication operator is found (i.e. the allocation size is computed by multiplying the element size and count), then this is a potential overflow risk.  
 e. Report the bug:  
  - Create and emit a warning with a short, clear message (e.g. "Potential integer overflow in kzalloc() call; consider using kcalloc() instead.").  
  - Use generateNonFatalErrorNode and std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create the report.

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:  
• No custom program state is required.  
• Register the checkPreCall callback.  
• In the callback, detect a call to kzalloc and inspect its size argument.  
• If the size argument contains a multiplication operator, issue a bug report advising to use kcalloc().

This concise plan provides the necessary concrete steps to implement the checker.
