1. Use the checkPostCall callback function to intercept calls to allocation routines.
   • In checkPostCall, retrieve the called function’s identifier.
   • Check if the callee’s name is "kzalloc".

2. Analyze the allocation size argument.
   • Extract the first argument passed to kzalloc.
   • Traverse the AST using the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren to determine if the argument is a binary multiplication expression.
   • Further inspect the operands: ensure that at least one operand is a sizeof expression (this indicates manual multiplication of allocation size).

3. Issue a warning if the pattern is detected.
   • If a binary multiplication (with a sizeof sub-expression) is detected in the argument to kzalloc, flag this as a potential integer overflow risk.
   • Construct a bug report (using, e.g., std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport) with the short message: "Manual multiplication in kzalloc may overflow. Use kcalloc instead."

4. (Optional) For additional confidence, consider using EvaluateExprToInt on the count operand to check if its value can be determined, although the simplest detection is to rely on the presence of the multiplication and sizeof.

No additional custom program states (like REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) or pointer aliasing are needed for this checker; the AST pattern matching in checkPostCall is sufficient.
