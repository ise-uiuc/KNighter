1. Customize Program States:
   • No custom program state is necessary for this checker because the detection only involves inspecting the call argument patterns of a function call.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use the checkPostCall callback to intercept function calls after they are evaluated.

3. Implementation Steps in checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, inspect the CallEvent to identify if the callee is kzalloc.
   • Retrieve the first argument of the kzalloc call, which represents the allocation size.
   • Use a downward AST traversal (e.g., findSpecificTypeInChildren) on this argument to check if it contains a binary multiplication expression.
   • If a binary multiplication (i.e., an expression of the form “sizeof(element) * count”) is found, it indicates that the allocation size is computed via multiplication, which is vulnerable to integer overflow.
   • Report this bug by generating a bug report with a clear, concise message (for example, “Potential integer overflow in allocation; use kcalloc instead.”).

4. Bug Reporting:
   • Utilize std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to create a report, attaching the source range information.
   • Ensure that the message is short and clear, as suggested.

This simple plan uses a single checkPostCall hook and a direct AST examination of the allocation argument, without additional state management or alias tracking.
