Your plan here
-----------------
1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No need to customize a program state (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) for this checker because the issue is local to one function call, so tracking extra pointer or alias information is unnecessary.

2. Choose the Callback Function:
   • Use the checkPostCall callback to intercept allocation calls.
   • In checkPostCall, filter for calls to kzalloc.

3. Implement the Callback in checkPostCall:
   a. In checkPostCall, obtain the call’s callee identifier. Check if its name equals "kzalloc".
   b. Retrieve the first argument (the size argument) passed to kzalloc.
   c. Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren (or equivalent AST traversal) on that size argument to search for a multiplication expression node (typically a BinaryOperator with the '*' operator). This confirms that the allocation size is computed via unchecked multiplication.
   d. If a multiplication expression is detected, then generate a warning message indicating: “Unchecked multiplication detected in allocation; use kcalloc() to avoid integer overflow.”
   e. Create and emit a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with the short, clear message.

4. Final Considerations:
   • Use the provided checkPostCall callback, and restrict the detection to kzalloc calls with an explicit multiplication in the size argument.
   • Keep the implementation simple by performing a text-based AST node search for '*' in the size expression.
   • No additional pointer state tracking or branch condition hooks are required in this case.

By following these steps, you can write a checker that easily spots the target pattern and reports the bug in a concise and clear manner.
