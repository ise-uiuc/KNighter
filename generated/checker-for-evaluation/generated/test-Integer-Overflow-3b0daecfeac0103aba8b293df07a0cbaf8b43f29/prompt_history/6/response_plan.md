Your plan here

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • In this case, you do not need to customize any program state (such as REGISTER_MAP/REGISTER_TRAIT) because the check is purely syntactic: it targets a call to kzalloc in which the first argument is computed as a multiplication. No alias or taint tracking is needed.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback function to intercept function calls. In this callback, inspect calls to kzalloc.

3. Implementation Steps in checkPreCall:
   a. Identify the Call:
      • In checkPreCall, check whether the Call event’s callee name is "kzalloc". You can use Call.getCalleeName() or Call.getCalleeIdentifier() to compare with "kzalloc".
   b. Inspect the Allocation Argument:
      • Retrieve the first argument (the size) of the kzalloc call.
      • Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren with the specific type (e.g., BinaryOperator) to search for a multiplication operation in the argument’s AST subtree.
   c. Verify the Multiplication:
      • Confirm that the multiplication operation is used to compute the allocation size. Optionally, check if one of the operands is influenced by user input (e.g., an identifier or field coming from a data structure that is user-controlled). You can use EvaluateExprToInt or further AST checks if needed.
   d. Report the Bug:
      • If a multiplication is detected in the parameter passed to kzalloc, generate a bug report. Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to emit a concise warning message such as “Unsafe multiplication in kzalloc allocation. Use kcalloc instead to prevent integer overflow.”

4. Summary of the Checker Flow:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept all function calls.
   • For each call, if the function name equals "kzalloc", inspect the first argument.
   • Look for a multiplication expression (using findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator>).
   • If a multiplication is present (and optionally if user-controlled value is used), trigger a bug report stating that using kzalloc in this way may result in an integer overflow and that kcalloc should be used instead.

This concise plan ensures that you check the relevant allocation call and its problematic arithmetic, then report a clear and short message to guide developers toward a safer allocation function.
