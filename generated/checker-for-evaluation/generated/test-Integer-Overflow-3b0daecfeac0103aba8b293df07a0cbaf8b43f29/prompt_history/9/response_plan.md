Your plan here

1. Decide if customization of program states is necessary:
   • No customized program state is required. This checker only needs to analyze the function call's argument expression and its structure, so we do not need to track dynamic state or pointer aliasing.

2. Choose the callback function:
   • Use the checkPostCall callback. This callback is triggered after a function call is processed and allows you to inspect the call arguments.

3. In checkPostCall:
   • Check if the called function is named "kzalloc". Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare its name with "kzalloc".
   • If the call is from kzalloc, retrieve the first argument from the call event, which represents the allocation size.
   • Analyze the first argument to determine if it is a binary multiplication expression (i.e. a multiplication operator). Use AST helper functions like dyn_cast on BinaryOperator for this.
   • Within the multiplication expression, check if one of the operands is a sizeof expression (or an expression that evaluates to an element size) and the other operand is a count value (e.g., a field like args->num_of_nodes) that might be user supplied.
   • Additionally, consider using EvaluateExprToInt if possible, to reason about the count bound if needed.

4. Emit a bug report:
   • If the multiplication is detected without any overflow checking (i.e. the multiplication is simply performed as an argument to kzalloc), generate a bug report.
   • Keep the report message short and clear (for example, "Unchecked multiplication in kzalloc may lead to integer overflow"). Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to create the bug report and call C.emitReport().

This concise plan should let you implement the checker using checkPostCall to capture kzalloc calls and inspect the unchecked multiplication in its memory allocation size argument.
