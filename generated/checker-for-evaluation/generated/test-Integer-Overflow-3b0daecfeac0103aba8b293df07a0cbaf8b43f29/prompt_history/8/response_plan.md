1. No need for any customized program state maps since this checker only needs to examine the arguments of an allocation function call. 

2. Choose the callback function checkPreCall:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept every function call.
   • Check if the callee’s name is "kzalloc" (using Call.getCalleeIdentifier()).
 
3. Inside checkPreCall when a "kzalloc" call is detected:
   • Retrieve the first argument of the call (the allocation size).
   • Inspect the expression to check if it is a multiplication operation:
       – Use AST casting (e.g. dyn_cast<BinaryOperator>) to see if the allocation size is a BinaryOperator with the '*' operator.
       – Optionally verify that one operand is a sizeof() expression (this makes it more specific, but is not strictly needed).
   • If the allocation size is computed by multiplication, flag this as a potential integer overflow vulnerability because a multiplication might overflow.

4. Report the bug:
   • Create a bug report with a short and clear message like "Potential integer overflow in memory allocation; use kcalloc to avoid overflow."
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to generate the report.

5. Summary of implementation steps:
   • Use checkPreCall to inspect each call.
   • For each call:
       – Verify if the call is to "kzalloc".
       – Examine the first argument to see if it is a multiplication expression.
       – If so, generate a warning indicating the risk of integer overflow.
       
This simple plan ensures that the checker lightens the fingerprint by targeting the specific pattern (multiplying sizeof with a count in a kzalloc call) and advises using kcalloc to get overflow protection.
