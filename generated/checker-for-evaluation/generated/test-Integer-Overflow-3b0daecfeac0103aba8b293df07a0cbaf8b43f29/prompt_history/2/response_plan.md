Your plan here

1. Callback Choice:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept every function call.
   • No need for custom program state maps (like allocation maps or pointer alias maps) because this bug pattern is detected by analyzing the call expression directly.

2. Detecting the Bug Pattern:
   • In checkPreCall, examine the CallEvent.
   • First, check if the callee identifier is "kzalloc". (You can use Call.getCalleeIdentifier()->getName() for this.)
   • If the call is to kzalloc, examine its first argument. Use findSpecificTypeInChildren to locate a binary multiplication expression (BinaryOperator) inside that argument.
   • Check that the multiplication expression involves a sizeof expression and a variable (e.g., args->num_of_nodes). This pattern indicates that two parameters are being multiplied without an explicit integer overflow check.

3. Reporting the Bug:
   • If the multiplication expression is identified, generate a short, clear bug report.
   • Use something like std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) with a message such as "Potential integer overflow due to multiplication in kzalloc; consider using kcalloc for overflow safety."
   • Emit the report using the CheckerContext’s report mechanism.

4. Edge Considerations:
   • (Optional) To ensure you have correctly identified the multiplication pattern, use EvaluateExprToInt (if applicable) on sub-expressions where constant folding might help.
   • Use ExprHasName to verify the presence of a specific structure (like "struct kfd_process_device_apertures") if needed.
   • Do not mark or track pointer aliasing because the role of this checker is only to spot the multiplication pattern in the allocation call.

Following these concrete steps in checkPreCall will allow you to write the checker that flags the use of kzalloc with multiplication for allocation, suggesting the use of kcalloc instead to avoid potential integer overflow.
