Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide if Program State Customization Is Needed

• No complex pointer‐or state tracking is required here.  
• You don’t need to create any additional program state maps since you are only looking for a specific usage pattern in the function body (i.e. for loops that iterate using a limit that’s too high and an array subscript on DcfClocks without a guarding condition).

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Detailed Steps

A. Use the checkASTCodeBody Callback to Analyze the Function Definition  
   • In checkASTCodeBody, filter for the function with the name “find_dcfclk_for_voltage”.  
   • Within that function body, traverse the AST to locate any ForStmt loops.

B. Inside the For Loop in “find_dcfclk_for_voltage”:  
   • Examine the loop condition:  
  – Use AST inspection (or getNameAsString() on tokens/macros) to determine that the loop iterates up to VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS (8).  
   • Use a helper AST visitor (or the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren) to look for any ArraySubscriptExpr subjects inside the loop which access “clock_table->DcfClocks”.  
   • Confirm that the subscript index used is the loop variable (e.g. “i”).

C. Check for a Guarding Branch Condition  
   • Within the same loop body, look for an if-statement (via checkBranchCondition) that performs a boundary check against VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS.  
   • Use getNameAsString() on the tokens in the branch condition to see if it mentions “VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS”.  
   • If you find a branch condition of the form “if (i >= VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS)” (or similar), mark that the array access is guarded and safe.

D. Report the Bug  
   • If you find an array subscript on DcfClocks using index i and no prior branch guarding the access against VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS, then generate a bug report.  
   • Use a simple error report (via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short message such as “Buffer overflow: out-of-bound array access on DcfClocks”.  
   • Emit this report at an appropriate callback location (e.g., from checkASTCodeBody after the AST scan or within a custom visitor during the loop walk).

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of the Implementation Strategy

• In checkASTCodeBody, restrict analysis to the “find_dcfclk_for_voltage” function.  
• Traverse the function body to locate the ForStmt loop that uses VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS as its limit.  
• Inside the loop, use AST helpers (and possibly findSpecificTypeInChildren) to detect array subscript expressions for clock_table->DcfClocks.  
• For each such occurrence, inspect nearby branch conditions (using checkBranchCondition) to check if there is an “if (i >= VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS)” guard.  
• If the guard is missing and the array subscript is found, report a bug indicating the potential out-of-bound access.

------------------------------------------------------------
That is your concrete, step-by-step plan to implement the checker.
