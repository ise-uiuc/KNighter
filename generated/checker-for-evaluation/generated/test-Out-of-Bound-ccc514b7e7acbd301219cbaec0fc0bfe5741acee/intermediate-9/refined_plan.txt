Your plan here

1. Determine the Checker’s Scope  
 • Limit the analysis to the function “find_dcfclk_for_voltage” (by checking the function name in checkASTCodeBody) to avoid false positives.  

2. Identify the Relevant AST Nodes  
 • Use checkASTCodeBody (or checkASTDecl if preferred) to visit the body of “find_dcfclk_for_voltage”.  
 • Within the function body, scan two kinds of nodes:  
  – Array subscript expressions that are used to access “DcfClocks”. Use findSpecificTypeInChildren or an AST walker to locate an ArraySubscriptExpr whose source text (via ExprHasName) contains “DcfClocks”.  
  – If statements (or branch conditions) within the loop: hook checkBranchCondition to identify any guard that checks the index variable “i” against “VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS”. Use getNameAsString on the macro values (or ExprHasName on the expression) to decide if the condition involves “VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS”.  

3. Implement the Checker Logic  
 • In checkASTCodeBody:  
  – First, check if the FunctionDecl’s name equals “find_dcfclk_for_voltage”.  
  – Traverse its function body looking for a for-loop. When a ForStmt is encountered, inspect its condition. Verify that the loop iterates using the upper limit “VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS”.  
 • Within the same ForStmt’s body:  
  – Use an AST query (possibly via findSpecificTypeInChildren) to locate an ArraySubscriptExpr that indexes “DcfClocks”.  
  – Also, check within the body (or nearby branch conditions via checkBranchCondition) whether an if-statement exists that validates “i < VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS” (or equivalently “if (i >= VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS)”).  
 • If you detect that the loop accesses “DcfClocks” without any guard ensuring that the index is less than “VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS”, then flag this as a potential out-of-bounds access.  

4. Reporting  
 • Create the bug report with a short, clear message using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> indicating that “Loop index may exceed the bounds of DcfClocks” (or a similarly concise message).  

5. Final Steps  
 • Since pointer aliasing or other complex state tracking is not needed here, there’s no need to customize program states with REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE.  
 • Use the provided utility function ExprHasName to check macro names in branch conditions and array expressions.  

This simple plan (using checkASTCodeBody to enter the target function, scanning for for-loops, ArraySubscriptExpr, and necessary guard conditions via checkBranchCondition) should allow you to detect the bug pattern of looping beyond the array’s bounds without extra program state tracking.
