## Bug Pattern

Using an incorrect loop bound when indexing an array, leading to an out-of-bounds access. In this case, the loop iterates up to VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS (8 iterations) despite the DcfClocks array being allocated with only VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS (7 elements). This mismatch in bounds can result in a buffer overflow when the index exceeds the array's size.
