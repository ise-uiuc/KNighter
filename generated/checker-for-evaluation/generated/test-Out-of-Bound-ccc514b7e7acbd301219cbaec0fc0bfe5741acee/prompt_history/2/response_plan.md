Your plan here

1. No custom program state maps are required for this bug pattern because tracking pointer aliasing or taint isn’t needed; we only need to analyze loop and array subscript semantics.

2. Choose Callback Functions:

 a. Use checkPreStmt to intercept array subscript expressions. In the callback, detect when the base expression corresponds to a structure member access of the DcfClocks array. (You can check the member’s name by retrieving its textual representation using getNameAsString() or similar.)

 b. In checkPreStmt, use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to look upward in the AST tree from the array subscript expression. Identify the containing ForStmt where the loop variable (say, i) is declared. In that ForStmt, examine the loop’s upper-bound condition. Use ExprHasName() to check if the constant VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS is used in the loop condition.

3. Identify the Flaw:

 a. In the same checkPreStmt callback, also retrieve the index expression used in DcfClocks subscript. Determine whether this index corresponds to the loop variable.

 b. Check if, within the loop’s body (use findSpecificTypeInChildren to search under the ForStmt), there is a branch condition (an if statement) that guards against i reaching or exceeding VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS. Use ExprHasName() to check for the presence of macro name “VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS” in the condition.

4. Report a Bug if Necessary:

 a. If the loop’s condition is based on VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS and no branch condition is found guarding the DcfClocks array access (i.e. no explicit check that i is less than VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS), then the checker should report an out-of-bound access.

 b. Generate a bug report with a concise message (for example, “Buffer overflow: DcfClocks array may be indexed out-of-bounds”) using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

5. Summary:

 • In checkPreStmt, detect an ArraySubscriptExpr accessing DcfClocks.  
 • Use findSpecificTypeInParents() to locate the ForStmt and inspect its loop bounds (which use VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS).  
 • Use findSpecificTypeInChildren() and ExprHasName() to determine whether a valid bounds check (against VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS) exists in the loop body.  
 • If not, report the potential buffer overflow.

This simple multi-step analysis relying solely on AST traversal and string matching ensures that you can catch cases where the array access is based on a loop counter whose range is too wide for the destination array size.
