1. Identify the Target Function:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, check for functions with the name "find_dcfclk_for_voltage". This ensures that the check only runs on the function where the bug pattern is expected.

2. Locate the For-Loop:
   • Within the found function body, traverse the AST to locate a ForStmt.
   • Verify that the loop iterates over a range defined by a constant (e.g., VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS). This can be done by checking the for-loop’s condition or initializer to see if it involves this constant.

3. Analyze the Array Access:
   • In the loop body, examine all array subscript expressions.
   • Specifically, detect a subscript expression accessing the DcfClocks array using the loop index (e.g., clock_table->DcfClocks[i]). Use AST traversal to extract both the base expression (to match “DcfClocks”) and the index variable.
   • No custom program state is necessary for this pattern since we are simply pattern matching the code structure.

4. Check for the Safe Boundary Condition:
   • Still in the same for-loop, look for any if-statement or guard condition that compares the loop index against another constant (e.g., VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS) and then issues a break from the loop.
   • Use the checkBranchCondition callback or, if more convenient, traverse the children of the for-loop's body with findSpecificTypeInChildren<IfStmt>().
   • Determine if such a condition exists. If it does, the buffer overflow risk is mitigated; if it does not, the potential bug exists.

5. Report the Bug:
   • In the absence of a guard condition limiting the index to the actual size of DcfClocks, generate a warning.
   • Use a concise report message such as: "Buffer overflow risk: loop index exceeds DcfClocks array size."
   • Create the bug report with std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) and emit it through the BugReporter.

6. Summary of Callback Usage:
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to process the function and its body.
   • Use AST traversal utilities (like findSpecificTypeInChildren) to detect ForStmt, IfStmt, and array subscript expressions.
   • No additional custom program states (such as REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) are required because the analysis is purely syntactic and based on constant values.

This plan uses a simple, few-step approach to detect if the for-loop runs the wrong number of iterations compared to the allocated size of the DcfClocks array, and it issues a warning only when the safe guard (i.e., the if-statement checking the boundary) is missing.
