1. Customize Program States:  
   • For this checker, there is no need to register additional program state maps because the check is based solely on analyzing the loop’s AST and comparing macro values. No pointer aliasing or taint tracking is involved.

2. Choose Callback Functions:  
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to process functions with bodies. This callback will allow you to analyze the function “find_dcfclk_for_voltage” where the loop resides.

3. Implement the checkASTCodeBody Callback:  
   • In checkASTCodeBody, first inspect the FunctionDecl. Use getNameAsString() to check if the function name is “find_dcfclk_for_voltage”.  
   • Once identified, traverse the function’s AST to find the ForStmt that loops over the voltage levels.  
   • In the ForStmt, inspect the loop’s condition and its initialization. Detect whether the loop iterates until VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS. You can use utility routines or compare the source text of the condition via ExprHasName to check for “VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS”.  
   • Then, in the loop body, search for the array access expression that reads from “clock_table->DcfClocks”. Use a downward AST search (for instance, a RecursiveASTVisitor or findSpecificTypeInChildren) to identify the subscript expression that uses the loop variable (e.g., “i”) as index.

4. Verify the Loop Bound Versus Array Size:  
   • Use getNameAsString or similar means on the subscript expression to extract the identifier for the related array size. Look for “VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS” in context (for example, in a binary comparison or in the declaration of the array’s size).  
   • Check if the index “i” in “clock_table->DcfClocks[i]” might exceed the valid range by confirming that the loop bound (VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS) is larger than the actual array size (VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS).  
   • Also scan inside the loop body for an if statement that checks “if (i >= VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS)” and performs an early break. Use checkBranchCondition or directly check the AST of the loop body for such boundary validation.  
   • If such a check is present, then the patch is applied and no bug report is needed; otherwise, the potential buffer overflow bug is confirmed.

5. Report the Bug:  
   • If the checker detects that the loop iterates beyond the valid array index range (i.e. no boundary check for i against VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS exists), generate a bug report with a short and clear message such as “Buffer overflow risk: loop bound exceeds array size” by using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport.  

By following these concrete steps, you ensure that the checker will detect cases where the loop iterates using VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS even though the associated array is sized using VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS, which might lead to a buffer overflow.
