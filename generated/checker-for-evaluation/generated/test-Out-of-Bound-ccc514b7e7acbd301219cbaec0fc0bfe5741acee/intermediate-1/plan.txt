1. Decide on Program States:
   • No custom program state maps are needed for this checker since we only need to check a constant comparison in a specific array subscript expression.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept ArraySubscriptExpr nodes.
   • Optionally, combine with checkBind if aliasing of the array base is a concern, but in this case it isn’t necessary.

3. Implementing checkPreStmt for Array Subscript:
   • In the checkPreStmt callback, determine if the statement is an ArraySubscriptExpr.
   • Examine the base expression of the subscript. Use the utility function ExprHasName to check if its source text contains "DcfClocks" (this identifies that the subscript is on the target array).
   • Retrieve the index expression of the ArraySubscriptExpr.
   • Use EvaluateExprToInt to try to evaluate the index expression to an integer value.
   • Compare the evaluated value with the expected maximum valid index. (For this bug pattern, the valid indices should be less than VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS, which is 7.)
   • If the evaluated index is greater than or equal to 7, then flag this as a potential out-of-bound access.

4. Reporting the Bug:
   • Use a bug-reporting mechanism (e.g., generate a non-fatal error node and create a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport) to report that the array “DcfClocks” is accessed with an index beyond its actual size.
   • Ensure your message is short and clear (for example: "Buffer overflow: index out-of-bound on DcfClocks").

5. Summary of the Steps in the Checker:
   • In checkPreStmt, check if the statement is an ArraySubscriptExpr.
   • Verify the base expression name includes "DcfClocks".
   • Evaluate the index expression using EvaluateExprToInt.
   • Compare the obtained integer value with the constant 7 (representing VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS).
   • If the index is not within bounds, call your bug-reporting routine and emit the diagnostic.

Following this plan should allow you to write a simple and effective checker that identifies when an array access may go out-of-bounds because the loop’s limit (VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS) exceeds the array’s allocated size (VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS).
