## Bug Pattern

Iterating over an array using a loop limit that exceeds the arrayâ€™s actual size. In this case, the loop iterates up to VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS (8) and accesses the DcfClocks array, which is only sized for VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS (7) elements. This mismatch allows an out-of-bounds access (buffer overflow) when the loop index reaches the invalid index.
