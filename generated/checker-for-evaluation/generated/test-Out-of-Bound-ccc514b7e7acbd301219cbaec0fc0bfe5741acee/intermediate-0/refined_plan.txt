1. No custom program state maps are needed for this checker.

2. Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept loop constructs (specifically ForStmt) where the problematic iteration happens.

3. In checkPreStmt:
 a. Detect a ForStmt and locate its condition expression.
  • Use utility functions (for example, ExprHasName) to examine the condition’s source text to see if it uses the macro "VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS".
  • Identify the loop index variable used in the condition (by looking for a DeclRefExpr in the condition or initialization).

 b. Traverse the body of the ForStmt using findSpecificTypeInChildren to search for an ArraySubscriptExpr that indexes “clock_table->DcfClocks”.
  • Confirm that the index expression in the subscript is the same as the loop index variable detected before.

 c. Check whether the code limits the index against the actual size of the array.
  • Use ExprHasName on the array’s type or on a nearby check to determine if the bound "VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS" is ever used.
  • If the loop condition uses VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS and there is no prior check (or any branch condition) ensuring the index is less than VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS, then this is a potential out-of-bound access.

4. If the checker finds that the index is being used to access clock_table->DcfClocks without validating that it is less than VG_NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS, report a bug:
 • Build a bug report (using e.g. std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a concise message like “Possible out-of-bound access: loop index may exceed array DcfClocks size.”

5. By using the utility function ExprHasName to match macro names (e.g. “VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS” in the loop condition) and by scanning the ForStmt body for the problematic subscript (with findSpecificTypeInChildren), you can keep the solution simple and effective.

This plan gives you a clear, step‑by‑step approach using checkPreStmt along with utility functions to detect the bug pattern and report it with a short, direct message.
