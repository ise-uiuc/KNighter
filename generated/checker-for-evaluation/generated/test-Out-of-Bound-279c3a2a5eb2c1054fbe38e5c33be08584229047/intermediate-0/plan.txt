Your plan here

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No customized program state maps are needed for this checker since tracking pointer aliases or memory initialization isn’t required.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Register your checker to hook the branch condition by implementing checkBranchCondition.
   • This callback will intercept if-statement conditions and allow you to inspect the expressions.

3. Implement checkBranchCondition:
   • Inside the checkBranchCondition callback, examine the condition expression to determine if it is a binary operator.
   • Use AST helpers (e.g., findSpecificTypeInChildren) to look for BinaryOperator nodes.
   • Check if the operator is the ">" operator.
   • Inspect the left-hand side to confirm it is the channel index (e.g., variable "adc_chan") and check the right-hand side to see if it is the macro constant "PALMAS_ADC_CH_MAX". Use getNameAsString or ExprHasName on the subexpression to match "PALMAS_ADC_CH_MAX".
   • If the condition uses ">" instead of ">=" (i.e. if the check is adc_chan > PALMAS_ADC_CH_MAX), then it is an off-by-one error.

4. Bug Reporting:
   • If the bug pattern is detected, generate a bug report with a short and clear message (e.g., "Off-by-one error: channel index check should use '>=' instead of '>'").
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create and emit the report.

5. Final Check:
   • Ensure that your checker only fires when the condition exactly matches the expected pattern (binary operator ">" with left-hand channel index and right-hand matching "PALMAS_ADC_CH_MAX").
   • Keep the implementation simple and straightforward by only analyzing the condition expression in checkBranchCondition.

Following these concrete steps will help you implement a CSA checker that identifies the off-by-one error in channel index validation.
