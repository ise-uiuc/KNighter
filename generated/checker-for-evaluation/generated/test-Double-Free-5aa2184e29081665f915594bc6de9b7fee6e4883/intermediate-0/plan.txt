Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Custom Program States

• REGISTER a program state map (e.g., AllocatedRegionMap) to track pointers that have been allocated.  
  – Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocatedRegionMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  – Mark an entry true when a memory allocation call returns a pointer that should be freed and false (or have no mapping) if the pointer was not allocated.

• Optionally, register a PtrAliasMap using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*) to track pointer aliasing. This is useful if the checker needs to propagate allocation status when a pointer is assigned to another.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

a. checkPostCall  
   – Intercept calls to allocation functions (e.g., kzalloc).  
   – When a call to kzalloc is detected, obtain its return value, derive the corresponding MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr(), and mark that region as allocated (set true in AllocatedRegionMap).  
   – This lets you track memory that should be freed correctly in error paths.

b. checkPreCall  
   – Intercept calls to kfree (or similar deallocation routines).  
   – Retrieve the pointer argument (e.g., match_hl or mt->fc) from the call event.  
   – Use getMemRegionFromExpr() to get the pointer’s region.  
   – Check the AllocatedRegionMap: if the region is not marked as allocated, a free is being attempted on a pointer that should not be freed.  
   – Emit a short, clear bug report (like “Double free of resource detected” or “Incorrect free in error path”) if the pointer is freed while not allocated.

c. checkBind (optional for aliasing)  
   – When pointers are assigned to each other (e.g., p2 = p1), update PtrAliasMap accordingly.  
   – This ensures that if one pointer is later checked (by a free call), its aliases are also treated as allocated or not.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Detailed Implementation Steps in Each Callback

• In checkPostCall:
   1. Identify the call expression; if the callee is kzalloc, then:
   2. Get the return value’s symbol and its memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr().
   3. Update the AllocatedRegionMap with an entry for the region (value true).
   4. (Optionally) also record the aliasing information in the PtrAliasMap.

• In checkPreCall:
   1. For each call to a deallocation function (kfree):
   2. Extract the pointer argument and get its associated MemRegion.
   3. Look up the region in the AllocatedRegionMap.
       – If the region is not present or marked as “not allocated”, then this free is being performed in an error path that frees unrelated resource (such as mt->fc when it was not allocated).
   4. Generate a short bug report using, for example, std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

• In checkBind (if alias tracking is used):
   1. When a binding statement is processed, check if a pointer’s value is being transferred to another.
   2. Record the alias relationship in PtrAliasMap.
   3. When a pointer is marked as allocated or when a free occurs, update all its aliases accordingly to keep the program state consistent.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary of the Checker’s Logic

• At allocation time via kzalloc, mark the returned pointer (match_hl) as allocated.  
• At deallocation time via kfree, verify that the pointer being freed is indeed from a successful allocation (its region exists in AllocatedRegionMap).  
• If a pointer (e.g., mt->fc) is freed when it has not been allocated (or if the deallocation is executed along an unintended error path), report a potential double free or free misuse bug.

This plan provides a simple three-step approach using checkPostCall for allocation tracking, checkPreCall for verifying deallocations, and (optionally) checkBind for pointer alias propagation. Each step is concrete enough to directly guide the implementation of your CSA checker.
