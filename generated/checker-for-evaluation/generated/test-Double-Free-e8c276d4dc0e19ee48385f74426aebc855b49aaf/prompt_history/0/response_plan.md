Your plan is as follows:

1. Customize Program State:
   • Register a mapping—e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedMemMap, const MemRegion*, bool)—to record whether a given allocation (represented by its MemRegion) has been freed.
   • Optionally, register a pointer alias map (PtrAliasMap) if you want to track alias relationships between pointers so that if one is marked freed, its aliases are also known to be freed.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   A. In checkPostCall:
      • Intercept calls to fastrpc_req_munmap_impl.
      • From the call event, extract the “buf” parameter’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Update FreedMemMap to mark the region as freed (set the value to true).

   B. In checkPreCall:
      • Intercept calls to fastrpc_buf_free.
      • Retrieve the parameter representing the buffer pointer and extract its base MemRegion.
      • Consult FreedMemMap to see if this region has already been marked as freed.
         – If the region is already freed (true), then generate a bug report. Issue a warning using a short, clear message such as “Double free of fastrpc buf”.
         – Otherwise, mark the region as freed to account for the current free operation.

   C. In checkBind (if aliasing is considered necessary):
      • When a pointer is assigned to another (to track aliases), update the PtrAliasMap so that if one of the aliases is marked freed, the state can be propagated to its aliases.
      • Do not mark the freed status in checkBind; just record aliasing to avoid false negatives in free checks.

3. Implementation Details:
   • In each callback, clearly check the callee name (using getCalleeIdentifier or ExprHasName) against the target functions (“fastrpc_req_munmap_impl” and “fastrpc_buf_free”).
   • Use helper routines (like getMemRegionFromExpr) to extract the memory region from the argument expression.
   • When reporting the bug, use a concise message (for instance, via std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) describing the double free of the fastrpc buffer.
   • Update the program state accordingly in each callback to maintain proper tracking of the freed state of the buffer.

Following these steps will allow you to detect when the same buffer is freed twice in error paths, matching the bug pattern in the provided patch without any extraneous complexity.
