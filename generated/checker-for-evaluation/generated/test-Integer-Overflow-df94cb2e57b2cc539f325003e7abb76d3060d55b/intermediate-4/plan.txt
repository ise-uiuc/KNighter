Your plan is as follows:

1. No customized program state is needed. This checker only verifies that certain disk-sector variables are declared with a sufficiently wide integer type (u64) rather than a narrow type (such as unsigned, which is typically 32-bit).

2. Use the AST-level callbacks:
 a. In checkASTDecl, process each function declaration. For every parameter in a FunctionDecl whose name (obtained via getNameAsString()) includes a keyword like "sector" (or "sectors" or possibly "disk_res"), check its type. Use the AST context to determine if the parameter’s integer type is wide enough. (If the type’s size is 32 bits, report a bug.)
 b. In checkASTCodeBody, walk through DeclStmt instances. For every variable declaration inside function bodies whose identifier contains "sector", use similar logic (for example, using QualType and the ASTContext’s getTypeSize()) to ensure that the variable is declared with a 64-bit type rather than an unsigned 32-bit type.

3. In each callback implement the following steps in detail:
 – For checkASTDecl: 
  • Retrieve each FunctionDecl and iterate its parameters.
  • For each parameter, if its name contains “sector” (or a related substring), check the type’s width. You may use the ASTContext’s getTypeSize() function to obtain the size in bits.
  • If the type width is less than 64, use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to create and emit a bug report. The report message should be short and clear (for example, "Improper integer type for disk sector count").

 – For checkASTCodeBody:
  • Traverse DeclStmt nodes in the function body.
  • For each variable declaration where the variable name contains “sector”, check the declared type as above.
  • If the variable’s type is a narrow integer (e.g., unsigned or unsigned int) rather than a 64-bit type, report the issue in the same fashion.

4. Reporting:
 – When a violation is detected, use generateNonFatalErrorNode to create an error node and then emit a bug report with a succinct message such as "Disk sector count declared with a narrow integer type" along with the source location for clarity.

This concise plan uses only the essential AST callbacks and type checks so you can quickly implement and verify that variables representing disk sector counts are declared with an appropriate integer type.
