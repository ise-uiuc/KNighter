Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • No custom program state is required because this checker will simply inspect AST nodes for type declarations and format strings.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use the checkASTDecl callback. This function will allow you to visit every function and declaration in the AST.
   • (Optionally) You may also use checkASTCodeBody if you want to examine the function bodies in more detail.

3. Detailed implementation steps:

   Step 1 – Identify the relevant function:
   • In checkASTDecl, iterate through all FunctionDecl nodes.
   • When a function’s name equals "bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply", inspect its body for local variable declarations.
  
   Step 2 – Check for insufficiently wide integer types:
   • Within the "bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply" function body, iterate over DeclStmt nodes.
   • For each VarDecl, check if the variable’s name is "disk_res_sectors" (or any variable that is used for holding sector counts).
   • Inspect its QualType. If the type is defined as “unsigned” (or an equivalent 32-bit type) rather than a wider type like u64, then flag it. You can use the AST type interfaces to determine if the type is a built-in unsigned integer and whether its width is insufficient.

   Step 3 – Check for mismatched format specifiers in error reporting:
   • In the same function, examine CallExpr nodes that call the diagnostic function “bch2_trans_inconsistent”.
   • Extract the format string literal (using, for example, getSourceText or by directly inspecting the Literal value).
   • Look for the format specifier “%u” intended for the disk sector count. Compare this with the expected wide integer conversion (i.e. %llu).
   • If the format string contains %u while the variable is declared with an insufficient type, flag the bug.

   Step 4 – Generate a bug report:
   • When a bug is detected according to Steps 2 or 3, create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short clear message such as “Insufficient integer width for sector count.”
   • Emit the report to notify the developer of the potential integer overflow issue.

4. Summary:
   • No program state maps or pointer alias tracking are needed for this check.
   • The entire checker can be implemented through AST inspection in the checkASTDecl callback.
   • Keep your implementation simple by focusing on the type of the variable “disk_res_sectors” in bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply and the format string used in bch2_trans_inconsistent.
  
Follow these concrete steps and you will have a simple, correct checker to detect the insufficient integer type bug pattern.
