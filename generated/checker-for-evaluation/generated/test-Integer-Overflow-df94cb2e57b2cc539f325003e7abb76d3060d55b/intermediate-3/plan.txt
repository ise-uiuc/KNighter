1. Decide on Program State Handling:
   • No customized program states are needed. This checker is based on static type checking (in both declarations and expression usage) so we do not have to track aliasing or pointer values.

2. Select Callback Functions:
   • Use checkASTDecl: Analyze function declarations to locate functions known to perform disk sector calculations (for example, "bch2_extent_fallocate" and "bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply"). In these functions, check the types of parameters and local variables that denote disk sectors (e.g., a parameter named "sectors" or a variable "disk_res_sectors"). If they are declared with a type like “unsigned” rather than the wider “u64” (or equivalent typedef), that could trigger a bug.
   • Use checkASTCodeBody: Walk through the body of these functions to examine expressions. In particular, look for arithmetic operations or macros (e.g., "min_t") which involve the “sectors” variable. Use the utility function ExprHasName to check that the usage mandates a u64 value (for example, verify that min_t’s first argument is "u64"). If the wrong type is being used in arithmetic or comparisons, flag it.
   • (Optional) Use checkBind if you want to track propagation of values from one variable to an alias. In our case, this is not strictly necessary since the bug pattern is purely type-based.

3. Implementation Details for Each Callback:
   • In checkASTDecl:
       – Inspect each FunctionDecl.
       – For each target function (identified by name or signature), iterate over its parameters.
       – Check if any parameter intended for disk sector values is declared as “unsigned” or similar narrow type.
       – Also, within the function body (if available), examine local variable declarations (such as "disk_res_sectors"). If these are declared with insufficient types, flag them.
       – If an issue is found, record the location and prepare to generate a bug report.
   • In checkASTCodeBody:
       – Traverse the function body AST.
       – For expressions that use the variable representing sectors, especially in arithmetic operations (like subtractions, or as parameters of macros such as min_t), use utility functions (like ExprHasName) to verify if the macro usage properly casts to u64.
       – If a “min_t” invocation does not use u64 as its type argument, add this as evidence of the bug.
   • Report the Bug:
       – When a function declaration or code body is found to use an insufficient integer type for disk sector calculations, create a bug report with a short message (e.g., "Potential integer overflow in disk sector calculations").
       – Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to generate the report.

4. Summary:
   • Do not use any complex state or pointer alias tracking as it is unnecessary.
   • Keep the checker focused on inspecting the AST for type declarations and expression usages related to disk sector arithmetic.
   • Use checkASTDecl and checkASTCodeBody callbacks to look at function signatures and bodies, respectively.
   • Emit a concise, clear bug report when an insufficient type (unsigned instead of u64) is detected.

Follow these detailed steps and include the provided utility functions (especially ExprHasName) as needed for a straightforward implementation.
