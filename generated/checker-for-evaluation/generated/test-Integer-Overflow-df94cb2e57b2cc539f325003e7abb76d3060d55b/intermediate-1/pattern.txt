## Bug Pattern

Using an insufficient integer type for tracking and computing disk sectors, which leads to an integer overflow. In this case, fields such as the reserved sector count were declared with a type (unsigned) that is too narrow to safely hold the potentially large values encountered (beyond 32-bit limits). This causes wrap-around or miscalculation when subtracting or comparing against large sector values. The patch fixes this by switching to a wider type (u64) and using safe arithmetic helpers (min_t(u64, ...)) to prevent overflow.
