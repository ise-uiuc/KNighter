Your plan here

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • No new program state maps are needed because this checker is based on static type analysis of a specific function’s local variable and specific arithmetic usages. We do not need alias tracking or taint information.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkASTDecl to inspect declarations in the AST. In particular, look at function declarations, and inside the target function “bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply” search for the local variable “disk_res_sectors.”
   • Use checkPreCall (or checkPostCall) to analyze call sites for the usage of safe arithmetic expressions (e.g. min_t) if desired. This is optional if you wish to signal misuse in arithmetic expressions.

3. Detailed implementation steps:

   • In checkASTDecl:
     - Identify the function declaration with the name “bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply” (use getNameAsString() on the FunctionDecl).
     - Traverse the body (AST) of that function and search for a local variable declaration named “disk_res_sectors.”
     - Check the declared type of “disk_res_sectors.” If its type is “unsigned” (or any type that is 32-bit) instead of a wider type (like u64 / unsigned long long), then this indicates the bug pattern.
     - Also ensure that the initialization of “disk_res_sectors” is from an expression like “trans->disk_res->sectors.”
     - When this situation is detected, report a bug indicating that an insufficient integer type is used for disk sector counts.

   • (Optional) In checkPreCall:
     - As an additional check, intercept calls where arithmetic operations are performed on such values (for example, calls to “min_t”). Retrieve the source text with ExprHasName to search for “min_t(u64” and check if arithmetic operations mix signed and unsigned types in a suspicious manner.
     - If found, also issue a warning that arithmetic using an inadequate integer type might lead to an integer overflow.

4. Bug Reporting:
   • In the checkASTDecl callback, when a problematic declaration is found, generate a non-fatal error node using generateNonFatalErrorNode.
   • Create a bug report via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short, clear message such as: "Disk reserved sectors count type may be insufficient causing integer overflow."
   • Emit the bug report using the CheckerContext’s reporting mechanism.

This simple plan directly targets the relevant function and variable declaration and ensures that when the insufficient type is used, it is caught early.
