1. No new program‐state maps are needed. This checker is purely static in nature—we’re only verifying that variables and format specifiers related to disk sectors are declared and used with the correct 64‐bit type.

2. Use checkASTDecl to detect vulnerable integer declarations:
 • In the checkASTDecl callback, examine function and global variable declarations.
 • Look for declarations where the variable name (or parameter name) contains “sectors” (or similar) and its type is declared as “unsigned” (or unsigned int) rather than a 64‐bit type.
 • If such a declaration is found (for example in a function like bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply or in a parameter of bch2_extent_fallocate), emit a bug report with a short message such as “Disk sector count variable has insufficient width (use u64).”

3. Use checkPostCall to catch mismatches in format specifiers:
 • In the checkPostCall callback, intercept calls to functions that log inconsistencies (for instance, with the name “bch2_trans_inconsistent”).
 • Retrieve the call’s argument that is the format string (using the provided AST functions and the utility function ExprHasName to extract source text).
 • Analyze the format string to see if it contains an improper specifier (e.g. “%u” instead of “%llu”) for a disk sector count.
 • If a mismatch is detected, report a bug with a concise message such as “Integer overflow risk: mismatched format specifier for disk sectors.”

4. In both callbacks, generate bug reports using simple bug report creation (e.g. std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short, clear message.

By following these steps you will detect places where the arithmetic on disk sector counts is performed with a type that is too narrow and where the logging formats do not match the intended 64‐bit variable.
