1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:  
 • No custom ProgramState maps are needed since this checker only inspects the AST and the arguments passed into function calls.

2. Choose callback functions:  
 • Use checkASTCodeBody to analyze function bodies and detect problematic declarations and call patterns.  
 • Use checkASTDecl to scan declarations if needed.

3. In checkASTCodeBody (or checkASTDecl) callback, perform the following steps:  
 a. Iterate over DeclStmts in the function body. For each variable declaration:  
  – Check for variables (e.g., “disk_res_sectors”) that are declared with the integer type “unsigned”.  
  – Specifically, look for assignments where the variable is initialized from expressions like "trans->disk_res->sectors".  
  – If the declaration uses “unsigned” but it is later used in calculations or comparisons with a disk sector count (which should be 64-bit), record a potential issue.

 b. Search for call expressions invoking functions (for example, bch2_trans_inconsistent) that use format strings.  
  – Retrieve the format string argument and use a utility like ExprHasName (or directly extract the literal text) to examine if it contains a mismatched format specifier.  
  – For instance, check if the format string contains “%u” when printing a variable whose type is expected to be a 64-bit value, and it should be “%llu”.  
  – If found, report a bug indicating a potential integer overflow due to a type being too narrow for disk sector counters.

4. Bug Reporting:  
 • When a problematic declaration or format string is detected, generate a bug report with a simple and clear message such as:  
  "Possible integer overflow: narrow integer type for disk sector counter"  
 • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to generate the report.

5. Implementation specifics:  
 • In checkASTCodeBody, make sure you traverse all relevant DeclStmts and CallExpr nodes.  
 • For each found variable, use the AST APIs to confirm its declared type (i.e., check if it is exactly an “unsigned” type rather than a 64-bit type like u64).  
 • For the formatting check, extract the text from the format string literal and perform a simple substring search for “%u” versus “%llu”.  
 • Emit the bug report at the appropriate location in the source code.

Following the above steps should allow you to write a concise checker that identifies the bug pattern where a disk sectors counter is declared as a too-narrow integer type leading to potential overflow and format specifier mismatches.
