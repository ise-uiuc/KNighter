Your plan is as follows:

1. Identify that no additional program-state maps are strictly needed. This is primarily a type‐analysis issue based on AST information. You do not need pointer tracking or tainting.

2. Use the AST callbacks to analyze function declarations and bodies. Two callbacks are sufficient:
 • In checkASTDecl (or checkASTCodeBody) inspect each function declaration.
 • For each target function, check for the disk sector count variable declarations and parameters.

3. In checkASTDecl (or checkASTCodeBody), do the following:
 a. Filter for functions having names "bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply" and "bch2_extent_fallocate".
 b. For "bch2_trans_fs_usage_apply":
  – Walk through the function body and locate the declaration of the variable named "disk_res_sectors".
  – Extract the declared type information for "disk_res_sectors" (use Clang’s type APIs). Confirm whether its type is a 32‑bit type (i.e. “unsigned”) instead of a 64‑bit type (u64).
  – If the variable’s type is not 64-bit, emit a bug report with a short message such as “Potential integer overflow: disk sector count variable uses small type.”
 c. For "bch2_extent_fallocate":
  – Check the type of the parameter named "sectors". Also inspect the locations where min or similar operations are applied (e.g. use of min_t(u64, ...)) by examining the AST.
  – If the parameter type is not u64, report a bug with a message like “Potential integer overflow: sectors parameter type is too small.”

4. To perform these inspections, use Clang’s AST API (for example, using getNameAsString() on the FunctionDecl and VarDecl nodes to compare names). No additional utility function is required for type comparison.

5. For reporting, in the callback you can create a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a clear and short message.

By following these steps, you will catch the use of a smaller integer type for disk sector counts and help prevent integer overflow issues.
