Your plan is as follows:

———————————————————————————————
1. Customize Program State:
   • Define a simple boolean flag in your program state using a REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE (or a small custom map) to record whether client ops have been set.
   • For example, create a flag named “ClientOpsSet” that is initially false for function cros_ec_uart_probe.

———————————————————————————————
2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use checkPostCall: This callback will be used to intercept call events inside the cros_ec_uart_probe function.
   • Use checkEndFunction: To reset any function-specific program state if needed.

———————————————————————————————
3. Implementation Details in checkPostCall:
   a. In checkPostCall, filter the calls occurring only within cros_ec_uart_probe (by checking function name if necessary).
   
   b. When a call is made to serdev_device_set_client_ops:
      – Update the program state flag “ClientOpsSet” to true.
      – (Optionally) Record that subsequent calls should observe that client ops are set.
   
   c. When a call is made to devm_serdev_device_open:
      – Retrieve the current “ClientOpsSet” flag from the program state.
      – If the flag is false (indicating client ops have not been set) then the ordering is incorrect.
      – Immediately report the bug with a clear, short message (e.g.: “Device opened before client operations set”).
   
   d. (Optionally) When calls to serdev_device_set_baudrate or serdev_device_set_flow_control occur, you may also check that they are only executed after the client ops are set. If not, you can also report a similar bug for improper initialization order.

———————————————————————————————
4. Additional Details:
   • There is no need for complex pointer or alias analysis in this pattern.
   • Simply tracking the ordering using a boolean flag in the program state is sufficient.
   • Ensure that your report message remains short and clear.
   • In checkEndFunction, clear the program state flag if required.

———————————————————————————————
This plan uses the simplest approach: tracking call order with minimal state, intercepting the relevant calls in checkPostCall, and reporting a bug when devm_serdev_device_open is called before serdev_device_set_client_ops. Follow these steps to implement an effective CSA checker for the provided bug pattern.
