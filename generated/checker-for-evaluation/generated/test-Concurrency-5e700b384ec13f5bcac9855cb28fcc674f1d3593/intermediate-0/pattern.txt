## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the incorrect ordering of initialization steps, where the device is activated (opened) before its critical function pointers (client operations) are set. In this case, calling devm_serdev_device_open() too early marks the device as active, which may immediately trigger callbacks that access serdev->ops. Since serdev->ops hasn't been initialized yet with serdev_device_set_client_ops(), the callbacks can attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a race condition and potential system crash.
