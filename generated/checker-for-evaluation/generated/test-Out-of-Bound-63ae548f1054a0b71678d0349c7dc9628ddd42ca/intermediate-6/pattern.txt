## Bug Pattern

Using a computed index to access an array without validating that the index is within bounds. In this case, the loop increments the index 'i' based on a calculated step, but it may exceed the size of the array (defined by TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS). This unchecked access can result in a buffer overflow due to out-of-bound array indexing.
