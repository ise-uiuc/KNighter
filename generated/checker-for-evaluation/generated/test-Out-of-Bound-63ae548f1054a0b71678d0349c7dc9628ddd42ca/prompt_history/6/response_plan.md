Your plan here

1. Decide on program state customization:  
 • No need to register additional program state maps (e.g. for pointer tracking) because the checker only needs to inspect array subscript expressions locally.

2. Choose the callback function:  
 • Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept ArraySubscriptExpr nodes. This lets you examine every array access before it is executed.

3. In the checkPreStmt callback:  
 a. Determine if the visited statement is an ArraySubscriptExpr.  
 b. Using a dynamic cast (or findSpecificTypeInChildren if needed), confirm that the array’s base expression is the one under scrutiny (e.g. check that the base’s source text contains "tf_pts" by calling ExprHasName) so that you narrow the analysis to the target data structure.  
 c. Retrieve the index expression from the ArraySubscriptExpr.

4. Evaluate the index expression:  
 a. Call EvaluateExprToInt on the index expression.  
 b. If the evaluation yields a constant integer value, proceed; otherwise, skip the check.

5. Check the index bounds:  
 a. Determine the constant value defined by TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS (for example, define an internal constant with that value or retrieve it via macro information if available).  
 b. Compare the evaluated index with TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.  
 c. If the index is greater than or equal to TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, this represents a potential out-of-bound access.

6. Report the bug:  
 a. Create a bug report with a short message (for example: "Array index may exceed TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS").  
 b. Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport to generate the error node.  
 c. Emit the report through the CheckerContext.

By following these steps in the checkPreStmt callback and using the provided utility functions (EvaluateExprToInt and ExprHasName), you can develop a concise checker that identifies when a computed index is used to access an array without adequately validating that it is within the macro-defined (or constant) limit TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.
