Your plan here

1. No custom program state is needed. You can detect this bug statically by inspecting the AST of the target function.

2. Use the checkASTCodeBody callback to detect when the function “cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format” is being analyzed. In the callback, check the function’s name (e.g., via getNameAsString()) and only proceed if it matches.

3. Within the function body, walk the AST (for example, by iterating over its children) and look for array subscript expressions that access the transfer function points. In particular, identify subscript expressions where the base expression corresponds to one of the color arrays (e.g. “output_tf->tf_pts.red”, “output_tf->tf_pts.green”, or “output_tf->tf_pts.blue”).

4. For every such subscript expression, use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to traverse upward in the AST and collect enclosing if-statement nodes. In each IfStmt, call the provided utility ExprHasName on its condition to see if it contains the string “TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”. This indicates that the index is being compared against the valid bound.

5. If you find a subscript expression that does not have any parent if-statement with a condition containing “TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”, then mark this as a potential bug.

6. Finally, report the bug using a bug report API (for example, by creating a std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message such as “Missing bounds check for TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”).
