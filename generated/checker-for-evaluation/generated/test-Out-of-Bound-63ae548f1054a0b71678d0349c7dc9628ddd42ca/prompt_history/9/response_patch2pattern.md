## Bug Pattern

Accessing an array using a loop-computed index without confirming that it is within the valid bounds. In this case, the index 'i' is used to access elements of the transfer function points array without verifying that 'i' is less than TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, which can lead to buffer overruns and potential memory corruption when the index exceeds the valid range.
