Your plan here

1. Decide on Program States  
 • No custom program state maps are needed for this checker since we only need to inspect the AST for array subscripting and the surrounding conditional checks.  
 • We do not need to track pointer aliasing for this pattern.

2. Choose Callback Functions  
 • Use checkPreStmt to intercept ArraySubscriptExpr nodes.  
 • Additionally, use checkBranchCondition to inspect if a proper bound‐check (i.e. “i >= TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”) is present in the code. This helps avoid false positives when the proper check exists.

3. Detailed Implementation Steps

Step 1: Detect Array Access on Transfer Function Points  
 • In the checkPreStmt callback, check if the statement is an ArraySubscriptExpr.  
 • Use the utility function ExprHasName on the base expression to see if it contains “tf_pts” (or specifically “tf_pts.red”, “tf_pts.green”, or “tf_pts.blue”). This ensures you only focus on the bug pattern in question.  
 • Extract the index expression from the ArraySubscriptExpr.

Step 2: Evaluate the Index Expression  
 • Use EvaluateExprToInt to try to evaluate the index expression into an llvm::APSInt value.  
 • If the evaluation succeeds, compare the resulting integer with the constant TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS. (Since TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS is a macro, use getNameAsString or extract the literal value from the source text if necessary.)  
 • If the index is greater than or equal to TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, flag this as a potential out‐of-bounds access.

Step 3: Check for Prior Bounds Validation  
 • In the checkBranchCondition callback, examine branch conditions that involve the index variable.  
 • Use ExprHasName to determine if the condition text contains “TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”.  
 • If such a branch exists in the context (for example, “if (i >= TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS)”), record that the index is guarded.  
 • You can mark the branch condition internally (for example, by setting a flag in a temporary variable) to avoid reporting a bug if the proper check is present.  
 • To keep things simple, consider only reporting a bug in the ArraySubscriptExpr callback when you do not detect any branch condition checking against TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS near the array access.

Step 4: Reporting the Issue  
 • If the index is determined to be out-of-bound (or not guarded by the proper conditional) in step 2, generate a bug report.  
 • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to report a short and clear message such as “Unchecked array index may exceed TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.”  
 • Call C.emitReport with the generated bug report.

This plan uses the simplest approach by focusing on the array subscript expression for the transfer function arrays and ensuring that any index used is either within bounds or is validated by a nearby branch condition checking against the macro TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.
