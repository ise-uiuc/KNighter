1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:  
   • In this checker, no complex pointer aliasing or state‐tracking is needed.  
   • We do not need to register any custom program state maps because we are directly checking array index expressions.

2. Choose callback functions:  
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept array-subscript expressions (or the binary operation that represents accessing the fixed-size buffer).  
   • Use the checkBranchCondition callback to examine any “if” conditions that may already guard the array access with a bounds check.

3. In checkPreStmt:  
   • Identify array accesses on the fixed-size buffer, for example by checking if the source expression uses a member access that contains “tf_pts” (or by using ExprHasName with the target field name).  
   • Extract the index expression from the subscript operator.  
   • Use EvaluateExprToInt to see if the index expression can be evaluated as a constant.  
  – If it is evaluable and the value is greater than or equal to TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS (the constant maximum valid index), then report a bug.  
   • If the index cannot be directly evaluated, try to infer its potential maximum value using inferSymbolMaxVal (if applicable) and compare it to TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.  
   • As an additional safeguard, use findSpecificTypeInParents to check whether the current array access is nested under an if statement that checks “i >= TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”.  
  – If such a branch condition is found, then assume the index is properly guarded.  
   • If no guarding branch condition is found for the index access, emit a short bug report (using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) indicating that there is a potential unchecked index, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

4. In checkBranchCondition:  
   • Hook every condition statement and examine whether the condition text (using ExprHasName) contains “TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”.  
   • If the condition appears to be a bounds check (e.g. “i >= TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS” or “i < TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”), then mark that the branch is guarding the later array accesses in that code path.  
   • This step helps avoid false positives if proper bounds checks are present.

5. Reporting:  
   • When a potential bug is detected (i.e. the index can exceed TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS without the proper guard), generate a concise diagnostic message such as “Unchecked array index may cause buffer overflow” and emit the bug report.

By following these concrete steps in the callbacks, you will be able to detect the unchecked array index bug pattern in a simple and focused way.
