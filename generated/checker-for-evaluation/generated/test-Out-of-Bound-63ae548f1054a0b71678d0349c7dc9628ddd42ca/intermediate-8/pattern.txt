## Bug Pattern

There is a lack of proper bounds checking on the loop index before accessing an array. Specifically, the code fails to verify that the index 'i' remains within the valid range of TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS when reading values from the transfer function arrays. This unchecked index can lead to a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds access) when 'i' exceeds the allocated array size.
