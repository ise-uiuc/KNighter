1. No need to customize program state – the checker can be implemented with a simple analysis using the AST callbacks and the provided utility functions.

2. Choose callback function: Use checkLocation. In checkLocation, we will inspect memory accesses that involve array indexing.

3. In the checkLocation callback:
 a. Determine whether the statement S (or one of its parent/child nodes) represents an array subscript expression. Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren (or findSpecificTypeInParents) to identify an ArraySubscriptExpr.
 b. Extract the index expression from the array subscript expression.
 c. Use the utility function EvaluateExprToInt to evaluate the index value to an integer.
 d. Compare the evaluated value against the constant TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS. If the index value is greater than or equal to TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, then the checker should report a bug.

4. Reporting the bug:
 a. Generate an error node (non-fatal) and create a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.
 b. The report message should be short and clear (for example: "Out-of-bound array index access").

5. Since the checker is only checking individual memory accesses and the bounds condition, no additional program state maps are required.

Follow this plan step-by-step in your checkLocation callback implementation to detect insufficient index bounds checking before accessing elements of fixed-size arrays.
