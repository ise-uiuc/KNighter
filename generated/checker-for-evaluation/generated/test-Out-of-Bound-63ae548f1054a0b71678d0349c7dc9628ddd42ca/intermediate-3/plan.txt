Plan

1. Identify the Need for Custom Program State:
   - No new program state maps or traits are needed since this checker only performs a static AST inspection–it does not require pointer alias tracking or taint analysis.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   - Use checkASTCodeBody to analyze the entire body of the function "cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format". This callback is ideal because we can inspect all the statements in the function and focus on the relevant array subscript expressions.

3. Implementation Details in checkASTCodeBody:
   a. Filter the Function Declaration:
      - In checkASTCodeBody, examine the FunctionDecl for "cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format". If the function name does not match, exit immediately.
   
   b. Traverse the Function Body:
      - Walk through the AST statements in the function body. You can use an AST visitor or a recursive routine to traverse the statements.
   
   c. Identify Array Subscript Expressions:
      - Look for ArraySubscriptExpr nodes that access elements of "output_tf->tf_pts.red", "output_tf->tf_pts.green", or "output_tf->tf_pts.blue". Use the utility function ExprHasName() to check if the base expression’s source text contains "tf_pts.red", "tf_pts.green", or "tf_pts.blue".
      - For each found ArraySubscriptExpr, extract the index expression (i.e. the part "i").

   d. Check for Bounds-Checking Condition:
      - For each array subscript access, go upward in the AST using the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents<IfStmt> (or findSpecificTypeInParents) to check whether any parent statement is an "if" with a branch condition.
      - Once an if-statement is located, examine its condition expression. Use the provided utility function ExprHasName() on its condition to check whether it uses the macro name "TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS" (or a numeric comparison against it). This indicates that the code performs a bounds check on index "i".
   
   e. Report the Bug if Missing Check:
      - If an array subscript is found without a corresponding parent if-statement (or equivalent branch condition) checking that "i" is less than TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, immediately report a bug.
      - Use a reporting function (e.g. generating a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a brief message such as "Potential out-of-bounds array access: Missing bounds check for index variable" to flag the issue.

4. Bug Report Generation:
   - Create a non-fatal error node when the bug is detected.
   - Emit a bug report with a short and clear message. Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create and emit the report.

Overall, this simplest approach uses checkASTCodeBody to focus on the specific function, walks its AST to identify array subscript expressions for the transfer function point arrays, and then verifies that there is an explicit branch condition that compares "i" with TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS. If such a conditional check is missing, the checker should flag a potential bounds-check bug.
