## Bug Pattern

Unchecked array indexing. In this case, the index variable 'i' is used to access the transfer function points in the output_tf->tf_pts arrays without first ensuring that it is within the valid range (i.e., less than TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS). This oversight may lead to a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access, potentially causing memory corruption or other security issues.
