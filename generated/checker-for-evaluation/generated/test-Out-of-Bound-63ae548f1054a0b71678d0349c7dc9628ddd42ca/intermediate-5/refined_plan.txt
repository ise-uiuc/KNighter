Your plan here

1. Identify the target function:
   • In checkASTCodeBody, scan for the function whose name is "cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format". This restricts your analysis to the relevant function.

2. Hook into array subscript expressions:
   • Use checkPreStmt to intercept ArraySubscriptExpr nodes.
   • For each intercepted node, use utility functions (for example, ExprHasName) to check if the base expression is the transfer function points array (e.g. by detecting “tf_pts.red”, “tf_pts.green”, or “tf_pts.blue”).
   • Also check that the index expression uses the variable “i” (by retrieving the source text or using DeclRefExpr analysis).

3. Check for bounds verification:
   • For each array subscript expression that uses index “i”, navigate upward in the AST (using findSpecificTypeInParents) to locate a branch condition or if statement.
   • Examine the conditions (using ExprHasName on the condition’s source text) to see if there is a check against TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS. In particular, search for a pattern like “i >= TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS” or a check ensuring “i < TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS”.
   • Do a simple evaluation: if no such branch condition is found in the containing loop or its parent, then the array access is potentially unsafe.

4. Bug Reporting:
   • If an unsafe array access is detected (i.e. an access via index “i” without a bounds check against TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS), create a bug report.
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short, clear message such as “Index out-of-bounds potential when accessing transfer function points.”
   • Emit the bug report with the CheckerContext’s emitReport.

5. No need for custom program state:
   • Since this checker only inspects the AST and verifies the existence of a condition checking the index bounds, you do not need to define any REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE or pointer alias maps.

Following these steps will guide you to writing a simple checker that detects the omission of a bounds check on an array index derived from “i” in the target function.
