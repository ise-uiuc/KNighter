1. Customize Program State:  
   • No new program states (like REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) are strictly needed because the bug detection is localized to the array index access in one function.

2. Choose and Implement Callback Functions:  
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept AST nodes corresponding to array subscript expressions.  
   • Inside checkPreStmt, first verify that the array access is occurring inside the function "cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format" (e.g. by climbing up the AST or checking the current function context).  
   • When an ArraySubscriptExpr (or the equivalent MemberExpr for the array field access) is encountered, retrieve its index expression.  

3. Evaluate and Compare the Index Expression:  
   • Use the helper EvaluateExprToInt to try to obtain an integer value for the index expression.  
   • Also, obtain the intended upper bound (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS). As it is a macro or constant, use getNameAsString (or a similar mechanism) if needed to compare against the target name and then retrieve its numerical value.  
   • If the evaluation of the index expression succeeds, compare the value with TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS. If the index is greater than or equal to TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, then the checker should report a bug.  
   • If the evaluation is inconclusive (e.g. the value is symbolic or cannot be reduced to a concrete integer), consider conservatively reporting a potential bug, since no explicit bounds check was found.

4. Reporting the Bug:  
   • Use a reporting helper (such as std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) to report a bug with a clear and short message such as "Array index might exceed TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS" or "Potential index out-of-bounds access."  
   • Ensure that the bug report is generated as soon as the checker detects the potential overflow condition.

5. Summary of Steps in the Checker:  
   • In checkPreStmt, detect the array access expression.  
   • Ensure the context is within cm_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format.  
   • Extract and evaluate the index expression using EvaluateExprToInt.  
   • Compare the computed index with the constant TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.  
   • If the index is not verified to be in bounds, report the bug immediately.

This concise plan uses the simplest approach with minimal steps, leveraging the available utility functions and the checkPreStmt callback to achieve detection of the target bug pattern.
