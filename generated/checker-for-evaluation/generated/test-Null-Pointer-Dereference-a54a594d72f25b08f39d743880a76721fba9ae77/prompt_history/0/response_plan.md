Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on the Program States

• In this case no custom program state maps are needed. We do not need to track aliases or pointer status across the function because our target is the ineffective pointer validity check in the “if” branch. We simply inspect the branch condition and its then statement.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose and Implement Callback Functions

A. Use the checkBranchCondition callback:

   • In checkBranchCondition, when an if–statement condition is encountered, examine the condition’s source text (by using getSourceText on the Expression’s SourceRange and/or ExprHasName) to detect if the condition is checking the validity of the interrupter pointer “ir.”
  
   • Look for key patterns such as:
       - “!ir”
       - “!ir->intr_num”
       - “ir->intr_num >=”
     These text substrings imply that a pointer’s validity is being checked.

B. Retrieve the then branch from the overall IfStmt:

   • Use a downward AST utility (e.g. findSpecificTypeInChildren<ReturnStmt>) on the then branch of the if statement to search for an early exit. (This is your indication that the branch handles the invalid pointer case correctly.)
  
   • Alternatively, if the then branch is a compound statement, iterate over its children and check if one is a ReturnStmt or an exit call (depending on your precision needs).

C. Report the error if the branch is incomplete:

   • If the branch condition corresponds to a pointer check (as determined in step A) and the then branch does not contain an early exit (i.e. no ReturnStmt was found), then report the bug.
  
   • Use a short text message such as "Unchecked invalid pointer may be dereferenced" when emitting the bug report.
  
   • Create a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) and emit it.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of the Implementation Steps

• In checkBranchCondition:
   1. Extract the condition’s source text.
   2. Compare the text with the key substrings (e.g., "ir", "intr_num") to decide if it is a pointer validity check.
   3. Identify the then branch of the if statement.
   4. Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<ReturnStmt> on the then branch to see if the branch exits early.
   5. If no early exit is found, report a bug with a clear and short message.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following this plan you can write the checker to flag an ineffective pointer validity check (where the invalid pointer is not used to later abort further processing). This solution is kept simple by leveraging the checkBranchCondition callback and the provided utility functions to navigate and analyze the AST.
