1. Customize Program State:
   • Register a program state map to mark subflow regions as freed. For example, use:
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedMemoryMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
   • This map will associate each subflow’s base region with a flag (true if freed).

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • checkPostCall: This will intercept calls that lead to freeing the subflow memory.
   • checkLocation: This will monitor field accesses and detect reads of a freed field.

3. Implement checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, check if the callee function is mptcp_close_ssk.
   • Retrieve the argument corresponding to the subflow. Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the subflow argument to obtain its base MemRegion.
   • Update the FreedMemoryMap by marking that region as freed (set to true).
   • This marks all subflow regions that have been released.

4. Implement checkLocation:
   • In checkLocation, when a load (read) occurs, check if the statement is a MemberExpr accessing the field "request_join".
   • Use the utility function ExprHasName to check whether the source text of the expression contains the string "request_join".
   • If yes, get the base memory region corresponding to the subflow (using getMemRegionFromExpr on the appropriate sub-expression).
   • Query the FreedMemoryMap to see if this region was marked as freed.
   • If the region is found and flagged as freed, generate a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport) with a short and clear message indicating “UAF: Access of freed subflow field.”

5. Alias Handling (if needed):
   • If aliasing might cause a subflow to be accessed by different pointers, use a separate PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) and track alias relationships in checkBind.
   • When a subflow pointer is bound to another, record the alias. Then, when marking a region freed or checking access, update or consult this alias map so that all aliases are considered.

By following these concrete steps in the designated callbacks, you can build a checker that tracks the freed subflow memory and warns when its field “request_join” is accessed after the free.
