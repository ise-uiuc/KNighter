Your plan here

1. Customize Program State:
   - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedSubflowMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     • This map will track subflow memory regions that have been freed (set to true).

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   - checkPostCall: Intercept calls to mptcp_close_ssk.
     • In checkPostCall, check if the callee is “mptcp_close_ssk”.
     • Retrieve the subflow argument (e.g. the third parameter) using getMemRegionFromExpr.
     • Update FreedSubflowMap by marking that subflow region as freed (true).
   - checkLocation: Detect reads from subflow members.
     • In checkLocation, for each load (IsLoad true), check if the accessed expression is a member access.
     • Use ExprHasName to check if the member being accessed is “request_join”.
     • Retrieve the base memory region of the member.
     • Query FreedSubflowMap: If the base region is marked as freed, generate a bug report.
       - Use a simple bug report message such as “Use-after-free: accessing freed subflow->request_join.”
   - (Optional) checkBind:
     • Use checkBind to track potential pointer aliasing from the subflow pointer, updating an alias map if needed, so that if one alias is marked freed, all related pointers are considered freed.

3. Implementation Steps in Followed Order:
   a. In checkPostCall:
      • Identify calls to mptcp_close_ssk.
      • Extract the subflow pointer argument.
      • Retrieve its MemRegion via getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Mark the region in FreedSubflowMap as freed.
   b. In checkLocation:
      • For every load operation, examine if the source expression is a member access.
      • Check if the accessed member’s name is “request_join” (using ExprHasName).
      • Trace back to the base subflow region.
      • Query FreedSubflowMap – if the region is flagged as freed, report the use-after-free bug.
   c. (Optional) In checkBind:
      • If a subflow pointer is stored into another variable, update the alias map (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)).
      • Ensure that when one pointer is marked as freed, its aliases are also recognized as freed.

4. Bug Reporting:
   - Use a concise bug message (e.g., “Use-after-free: accessing freed subflow->request_join”).
   - Create the bug report with std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> once a violation is detected.

Following these concrete steps and the callbacks above, you will successfully detect when a member of a subflow structure (specifically “request_join”) is accessed after the subflow has been freed via mptcp_close_ssk.
