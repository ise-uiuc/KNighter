## Bug Pattern

Reading a member of an object after the object has been closed and freed. In this case, the code accesses subflow->request_join after calling mptcp_close_ssk(), which frees the subflow structure. This use-after-free occurs because the necessary information is not retrieved (or copied) before the subflow object is deallocated.
