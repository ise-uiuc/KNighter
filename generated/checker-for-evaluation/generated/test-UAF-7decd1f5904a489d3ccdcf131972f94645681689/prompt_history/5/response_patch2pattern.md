## Bug Pattern

Accessing a field of an object (in this case, subflow->request_join) after the object has been freed. The bug arises from the ordering of operations: the code reads subflow->request_join after calling mptcp_close_ssk (which frees the subflow), thereby resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
