1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a map with program state: REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedObjectMap, const MemRegion *, bool)
     – This map will track the memory regions corresponding to subflow objects that have been freed.

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. In checkPostCall:
      • Intercept calls to the function mptcp_close_ssk.
      • Within checkPostCall, check if the callee’s name is "mptcp_close_ssk".
      • Retrieve the subflow pointer argument (e.g. the third parameter of mptcp_close_ssk) by using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Update Frees: In the FreedObjectMap, record the corresponding MemRegion with a flag set to true to indicate that the subflow is freed.

   B. In checkLocation:
      • Intercept every memory read (dereference) operation.
      • Retrieve the MemRegion corresponding to the object being read using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Look up this MemRegion in FreedObjectMap. If the region is marked as freed (flag true), then this indicates a use-after-free.
      • Emit a bug report with a concise message (e.g., "Use-after-free: reading a field of a freed subflow object") using a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport.

3. Additional Considerations:
   • There is no need for complex pointer alias tracking in this simple implementation, so PtrAliasMap or checkBind modifications are omitted.
   • Use the utility function getMemRegionFromExpr for both marking the freed subflow object in checkPostCall and later for checking in checkLocation.
   • The plan focuses on simplicity: mark the object as freed at mptcp_close_ssk and later warn when its members are accessed.
   
This organized plan should help you implement the checker efficiently with a minimal set of steps while following the provided guidelines.
