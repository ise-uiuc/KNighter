Your plan here

1. Decide on Program State:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedSubflowMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will track subflow regions that have been freed (set to true after the call to mptcp_close_ssk).

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. checkPostCall:
      – In checkPostCall, intercept calls to the function mptcp_close_ssk.
      – Retrieve the subflow pointer argument from the call. Use the utility function getMemRegionFromExpr on the corresponding expression.
      – Update the program state by marking the subflow region in FreedSubflowMap as freed (true).

   B. checkPreStmt:
      – In checkPreStmt, focus on MemberExpr nodes that access a field from a subflow object.
      – Specifically, check if the accessed field has the name "request_join". Use the utility function ExprHasName on the expression corresponding to the member base.
      – Retrieve the base's MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      – Look up this region in FreedSubflowMap. If it is found and marked as freed, then generate a bug report signaling a use‐after‐free (e.g. using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a clear, short message).

3. Reporting:
   – The report message should be clear and brief (e.g. "Use-after-free: subflow field 'request_join' accessed after memory free").

This simple two-callback plan (one for marking freed subflow regions and one for detecting subsequent unsafe field accesses) lets you detect the pattern outlined in the target patch in a straightforward and concrete way.
