1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedMemMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will track if a subflow region has been freed (true if freed).
   • Optionally, REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
     – Use this to propagate state to any aliases of the freed subflow if necessary.

2. Hook Freed Memory Marking:
   • Use the checkPostCall callback.
   • In checkPostCall, check if the called function is mptcp_close_ssk.
   • Retrieve the subflow argument passed to mptcp_close_ssk (the one corresponding to the object being freed).
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr to obtain the MemRegion of the subflow.
   • Update the FreedMemMap in the current program state to mark this MemRegion as freed.
   • Optionally update PtrAliasMap if alias propagation is needed.

3. Detecting UAF Read:
   • Use the checkLocation callback.
   • In checkLocation, intercept any read (IsLoad true) of a location whose base originates from a subflow.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the base pointer expression (for instance, if the field ‘request_join’ is being accessed).
   • Look up the region in FreedMemMap.
   • If the region is marked as freed, then generate a bug report using a simple message like "UAF read of freed object".
   • Emit the report via C.emitReport with a PathSensitiveBugReport or BasicBugReport.

4. Tracking Aliases:
   • Use checkBind to track pointer assignments.
   • In checkBind, whenever a pointer to a subflow is stored into another pointer, update the PtrAliasMap in the program state so that if one alias is marked freed, the others are also recognized as freed.
   • When marking a region as freed in checkPostCall, propagate the status to its aliases via the PtrAliasMap.

By following these steps and using the provided utility functions, you can write a checker that correctly tracks subflow objects freed by mptcp_close_ssk and warns if any fields (like request_join) of those freed objects are later read.
