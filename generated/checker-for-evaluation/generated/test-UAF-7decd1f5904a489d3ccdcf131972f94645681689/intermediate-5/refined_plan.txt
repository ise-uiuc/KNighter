Your plan is outlined below:

──────────────────────────────
1. Customize Program States

• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedSubflowMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
  – This map will associate the memory region corresponding to a “subflow” with a Boolean flag indicating whether it has been freed.
  – Initially, the region is not marked as freed. When mptcp_close_ssk() is called, mark the region as freed.

──────────────────────────────
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. checkPostCall
 • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to mptcp_close_ssk.
 • Identify the call by comparing the callee name to “mptcp_close_ssk”.
 • Retrieve the subflow pointer argument from the call (e.g. the third parameter). Use getMemRegionFromExpr() to extract its MemRegion.
 • Update the program state: mark the subflow region in FreedSubflowMap as freed (set to true).

B. checkLocation
 • In checkLocation, check every load/store for accessing a field.
 • Filter the access to catch MemberExpr that accesses the “request_join” field.
 • Retrieve the base pointer (i.e., the subflow object) that is being dereferenced.
 • Use getMemRegionFromExpr() to obtain its MemRegion.
 • Look up the region in FreedSubflowMap; if the region is marked as freed, then generate a bug report.
  – The report message should be short and clear (for example: “Use-after-free: Accessing field request_join on a freed subflow.”).

C. Optional: checkBind
 • If you wish to track pointer aliases (so that if the subflow pointer is assigned to another variable, its freed status is propagated), use checkBind.
 • In checkBind, update a PtrAliasMap (if you choose to customize aliasing) in the program state so that any alias of the freed pointer also inherits the freed property.
  – This step is optional if you assume that the subflow pointer is used directly.

3. Implementation Details for Each Step

Step 1. Program State Setup:
 – In your checker’s constructor, register the program state map:
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedSubflowMap, const MemRegion*, bool)

Step 2A. Implementing checkPostCall:
 1. In checkPostCall, check if the callee is “mptcp_close_ssk” (use Call.getCalleeName() or similar).
 2. Identify the subflow pointer argument (likely the third argument). Use getMemRegionFromExpr() on that argument.
 3. Retrieve the current program state, mark the found region as freed, and update the state accordingly.

Step 2B. Implementing checkLocation:
 1. In checkLocation, inspect the Stmt S to see if it is a dereference of “request_join” (for example, by dynamically casting to a MemberExpr and comparing the field name via getNameAsString() or ExprHasName()).
 2. Retrieve the base object’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr().
 3. Check if this region is in FreedSubflowMap and flagged as freed.
 4. If it is, generate an error node and emit a bug report with a succinct message.

Step 2C. (Optional) Implementing checkBind:
 1. In checkBind, when a pointer is bound to another variable, record the aliasing relationship using a PtrAliasMap registered with program state.
 2. When the pointer that has been marked as freed is propagated, update the alias mapping so that later checks in checkLocation will catch the use of the alias as well.

──────────────────────────────
4. Bug Reporting

• Report bugs by creating a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short message like:
  “UAF: Accessing field request_join on a freed subflow.”
• In checkLocation, when a freed subflow is detected, generate a non-fatal error node and emit the bug report.

──────────────────────────────
Summary

Your checker will use a program state map (FreedSubflowMap) to track when subflow objects are freed by intercepting mptcp_close_ssk() in checkPostCall. Then, in checkLocation, the checker will spot any accesses to the “request_join” field, which indicate a use-after-free if the subflow’s region is marked as freed. Use utility functions (like getMemRegionFromExpr) to help extract the memory regions and correctly propagate the freed status via checkBind if aliasing is involved. This simple three-step approach meets the requirements for detecting the use-after-free vulnerability in the target patch.
