Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State

• Use a program state map to track whether a subflow object has been freed.  
 – Declare a map with:  
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedSubflowMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
 This map will associate the memory region for a subflow with a flag (true if freed).

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. Tracking the Freeing of a Subflow (checkPostCall)  
 • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to mptcp_close_ssk.  
 • In this callback, check if the callee’s name is "mptcp_close_ssk".  
 • Retrieve the third argument “subflow” by using Call.getArg(2) and use the utility function getMemRegionFromExpr to get the base MemRegion.  
 • Update the program state by adding an entry in FreedSubflowMap for that region, e.g. mark it as freed (true).  

B. Catching the Use-after-Free Read (checkLocation)  
 • In checkLocation, examine every load operation.  
 • For each load, try to determine if the accessed memory belongs to a subflow by calling getMemRegionFromExpr on the expression S (or using an appropriate mechanism to get the subflow’s base region).  
 • Look up the obtained region in FreedSubflowMap.  
  – If it is found and marked as freed, then generate a bug report.  
  – Use a simple error message such as: "Use-after-free: accessing 'request_join' after subflow has been freed".  
 • Report the bug with a short message using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Details in Callbacks

• In checkPostCall:
 – Confirm the call is to “mptcp_close_ssk” using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and comparing names.
 – Extract the subflow argument and derive its MemRegion.
 – Update the current program state state = state->set<FreedSubflowMap>(subflowRegion, true).

• In checkLocation:
 – For every load (IsLoad true), get the relevant Expr region using getMemRegionFromExpr.
 – If the region exists in FreedSubflowMap and the flag is true, report an error node.
 – Ensure that you do not trigger false positives by limiting your check to member accesses that correspond to the subflow structure (e.g. if the expression’s source text contains "request_join", you may optionally confirm that it’s the field access in question, using ExprHasName).

--------------------------------------------------
4. Summary

• The checker uses a single customized program state map (FreedSubflowMap) to monitor subflow freeing events in checkPostCall.  
• It then detects any load from a subflow region that has been freed in checkLocation.  
• When such a use-after-free is detected, a concise bug report is generated.

--------------------------------------------------

Follow these concrete steps to implement the checker. This plan is minimal yet concrete enough for you to track subflow lifetime and immediately report any later access (like the "request_join" field read) after mptcp_close_ssk has freed the object.
