## Bug Pattern

Dereferencing an optional pointer without checking for NULL. In this case, the code calls devm_gpiod_get_array_optional() which may return NULL (indicating that the "im" GPIOs are not provided), but then immediately accesses lcd->im_pins->ndescs without checking if lcd->im_pins is non-NULL, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference if no "im" GPIOs are available.
