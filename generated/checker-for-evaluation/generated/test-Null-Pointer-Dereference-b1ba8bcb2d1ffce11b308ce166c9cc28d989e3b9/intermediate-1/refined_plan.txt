Your plan here

1. Use a custom program state:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(OptionalPtrCheckedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will associate the memory region obtained from devm_gpiod_get_array_optional with a boolean flag. Initially, mark it false (unchecked) and later update it to true when a proper NULL-check is observed.

2. Use checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to devm_gpiod_get_array_optional.
   • If a call to devm_gpiod_get_array_optional is detected, extract its return value’s MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr or similar) and update OptionalPtrCheckedMap by associating this region with false (i.e., not yet checked).
   • This setup marks any optional pointer returned from this function as needing a subsequent NULL-check.

3. Use checkBranchCondition:
   • In checkBranchCondition, analyze branch conditions (if statements) for expressions that check the pointer returned by devm_gpiod_get_array_optional.
   • If the condition explicitly tests the pointer (e.g., “if (ptr)” or “if (ptr != NULL)”), determine the corresponding MemRegion.
   • For the identified pointer, update OptionalPtrCheckedMap by setting its flag to true, thereby marking it as properly NULL-checked.
   • (Optionally, if pointer aliasing is involved, use a helper with checkBind and a PtrAliasMap to propagate the checked status.)

4. Use checkLocation:
   • In checkLocation, intercept dereference events.
   • Specifically, check for member access operations (e.g., accessing ->ndescs) where the base expression is obtained from devm_gpiod_get_array_optional.
   • Retrieve the MemRegion for the base pointer.
   • Look up this region in OptionalPtrCheckedMap. If the region exists and its flag is still false (unchecked), then it means the optional pointer is being dereferenced without a NULL-check.
   • Immediately report this bug by generating a non-fatal error node and emitting a short, clear bug report (e.g., “Optional pointer not checked before dereference”).

5. Bug Reporting:
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a concise message.
   • Ensure that the bug report is emitted only once when the first occurrence of the erroneous dereference is detected.

By following these steps, you will track the returned optional pointer from devm_gpiod_get_array_optional, observe whether it is guarded by an if-statement, and flag its dereference when the NULL check is omitted.
