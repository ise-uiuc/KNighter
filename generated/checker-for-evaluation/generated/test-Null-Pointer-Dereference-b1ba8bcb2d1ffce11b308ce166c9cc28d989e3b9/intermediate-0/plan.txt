Your plan is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program States

• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(OptionalResourceMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  – This map will record pointers returned from devm_gpiod_get_array_optional() with an initial value false (meaning “unchecked”)  
• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)  
  – This map tracks pointer aliasing so that when one pointer in an alias group gets checked against NULL the others are updated accordingly

----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Callback: checkPostCall

• In checkPostCall, intercept the call event.  
• Check if the callee is devm_gpiod_get_array_optional (compare by string).  
• If yes, obtain the returned pointer’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr().  
• Insert the region into OptionalResourceMap with a value of false (indicating that it has not been null-checked yet).  
• (Optionally) do not alter alias information here since checkBind will handle alias propagation.

----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Callback: checkBind

• In checkBind, track assignments where an optional resource pointer is copied or stored into another pointer.
• When a binding occurs, check if the RHS pointer’s region exists in OptionalResourceMap.
• If so, record in PtrAliasMap that the LHS pointer’s region is aliasing the original.
• This ensures that if one pointer is later checked (see step 4), the “checked” information is propagated to its aliases.

----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Callback: checkBranchCondition

• In checkBranchCondition, inspect each condition expression.
• Look for binary comparisons that test the optional pointer against NULL or conditions like “if (ptr)”. Use utility functions such as ExprHasName to help match the pointer’s name.
• If you identify that the pointer (or one of its aliases) obtained from devm_gpiod_get_array_optional is being checked (e.g., pointer != NULL, pointer, or !pointer), update that pointer’s entry in OptionalResourceMap by setting its value to true.
• Also update the corresponding aliases in PtrAliasMap to ensure they are marked checked.

----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Callback: checkLocation

• In checkLocation, monitor any load operations (dereferences) on memory.
• When a load occurs, determine the memory region being dereferenced (using getMemRegionFromExpr or findSpecificTypeInParents if needed).
• If the dereferenced region exists in OptionalResourceMap and the value is still false, then it means the optional resource’s result has not been checked before being used.
• Report the bug by generating a non‐fatal error node and issue a short bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a message like “Optional resource not checked for NULL before dereference.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
6. Bug Reporting

• In your checkLocation when the bug is detected, create a bug report with a concise message.
• Use generateNonFatalErrorNode() (or the equivalent) to attach the report.
• Ensure the report is succinct (e.g., “Optional resource not NULL-checked before dereference”) while linking to the affected code location.

----------------------------------------------------------------

This plan uses the simplest steps: track the allocation in checkPostCall, propagate pointer aliasing in checkBind, update the “checked” flag in checkBranchCondition, and finally analyze pointer dereferencing in checkLocation to report any unchecked usage. This approach minimizes complexity while covering the target bug pattern effectively.
