Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Use a Program State Map:  
   • Define a state map (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(OptionalPtrMap, const MemRegion *, bool)) to associate the MemRegion for a pointer returned by devm_gpiod_get_array_optional with a “null‐checked” flag.  
   • Initially, when the allocation call returns a value, mark it as false (i.e. not checked).

2. Insert a Callback in checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to devm_gpiod_get_array_optional.  
   • If the call returns a non-error pointer, obtain its corresponding MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr).  
   • Record this region in the OptionalPtrMap with the flag set to false. This marks that the optional pointer has not yet been validated for NULL.

3. Use checkBranchCondition to Mark the Pointer as Checked:
   • In checkBranchCondition, analyze the condition expression of if-statements.  
   • Identify if the condition is testing the optional pointer for NULL (for example, comparisons like “if (ptr)” or “if (ptr != NULL)” or “if (!ptr)”).  
   • Once you determine that the optional pointer is being checked, update the program state (and propagate via PtrAliasMap if necessary) so that the corresponding region in OptionalPtrMap is marked true (i.e. checked).

4. Use checkBind for Alias Tracking:
   • In checkBind, monitor assignments in which the optional pointer is propagated to another variable.  
   • Update the alias map (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) so that if one alias is marked as checked later in a branch condition, the update also applies to its aliases.

5. Use checkLocation to Detect Dereference:
   • In checkLocation, intercept memory loading from a pointer (e.g. when the pointer is dereferenced).  
   • Retrieve the pointer’s MemRegion.  
   • If the region appears in OptionalPtrMap and its flag is still false (not checked), immediately generate a bug report.  
   • Use a simple, short warning message (e.g. “Optional pointer not checked for NULL before dereference”), and create the bug report with a call like std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

--------------------------------------------------
This plan uses the simplest combination of state tracking and AST traversal:  
• The allocation (via devm_gpiod_get_array_optional) is recorded in checkPostCall.  
• The subsequent null-check is detected via checkBranchCondition.  
• Pointer propagation is handled in checkBind.  
• The final unsafe dereference is caught in checkLocation.

Following these concrete steps with the provided utility functions will enable you to correctly detect this bug pattern.
