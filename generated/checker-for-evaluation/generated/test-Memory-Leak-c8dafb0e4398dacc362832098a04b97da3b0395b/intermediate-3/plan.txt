Your plan here

1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a program state map that tracks whether an allocated request has been freed.
     - Use: REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UnfreedReqMap, const MemRegion *, bool)
   • (Optionally) REGISTER a PtrAliasMap to trace aliasing relationships if needed for complex pointer analyses.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • checkPostCall:
       - Hook calls to allocation functions.
       - For hwrm_req_init: When the call succeeds, extract the “req” pointer’s MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and add it to UnfreedReqMap with a true flag (“allocated but not freed”).
       - For hwrm_req_replace: Check the return value (error code). If the call returns a non-zero error value, then look up the “req” pointer’s MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) in UnfreedReqMap.
           • If the region is still marked as unfreed, then it indicates that the error-handling path is returning early without calling hwrm_req_drop.
           • At that point, report a bug with a short message (e.g., "Resource leak: allocated request not freed in error path").

   • checkPreCall:
       - Hook the cleanup function call.
       - For hwrm_req_drop: When this function is encountered, extract the “req” pointer’s MemRegion and update the program state by removing or unmarking it in UnfreedReqMap.
         • This ensures that later error paths will not report a bug if the resource is properly cleaned up.

3. Detailed Implementation Steps:
   1. In checkPostCall, check if the current call’s callee name matches "hwrm_req_init". If yes:
         • Extract the appropriate request argument’s MemRegion.
         • Update UnfreedReqMap to mark that region as still allocated.
   2. In checkPostCall, check for a call to "hwrm_req_replace". If the hwrm_req_replace call returns a non-zero error code:
         • Extract the same “req” region it uses.
         • Use the UnfreedReqMap to verify that the region is still marked as allocated (i.e. no cleanup has occurred).
         • If found, immediately generate a bug report using a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport with a concise message indicating the potential leak.
   3. In checkPreCall, for calls matching "hwrm_req_drop":
         • Extract the “req” region from the argument.
         • Update the UnfreedReqMap to mark that resource as freed.
   4. (Optionally) In checkBind, track aliasing if the “req” pointer is copied into another variable; update the PtrAliasMap accordingly so that when one alias is cleaned up, all related mappings become updated.

4. Reporting:
   • Use a call to generate an error node (generateNonFatalErrorNode) and create a bug report with a short clear message.
   • For example: "Resource leak: allocated request is not freed on error path", and attach the relevant source range for clarity.

This plan minimizes steps yet ensures that all key events (allocation, potential failure, and cleanup) are monitored. Following these steps will enable you to write a checker that detects early returns in an error path where the local resource is not freed properly.
