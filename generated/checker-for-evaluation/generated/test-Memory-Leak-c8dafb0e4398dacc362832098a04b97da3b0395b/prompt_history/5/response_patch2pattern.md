## Bug Pattern

Failure to clean up allocated resources on error paths. In this case, if hwrm_req_replace() fails, the allocated request is not released by calling hwrm_req_drop(), resulting in a memory leak. This pattern involves returning early on error without performing necessary cleanup of resources acquired earlier in the function.
