1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ReqStatusMap, const MemRegion*, bool): This map will track the cleanup status of the “req” pointer. An entry is added when hwrm_req_replace returns an error (rc ≠ 0) and indicates that a cleanup (via hwrm_req_drop) is required. The boolean value is initially false (meaning not dropped) and will be set to true once cleanup is performed.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • checkPostCall: 
     - Intercept calls to hwrm_req_replace.
     - Examine the return value (using EvaluateExprToInt) to determine if an error occurred.
     - If the return code is non-zero, obtain the “req” argument (typically the second parameter) by using getMemRegionFromExpr.
     - Store the obtained req region into the ReqStatusMap with a flag set to false (indicating that cleanup has not yet been invoked).

   • checkPreCall:
     - Intercept calls to hwrm_req_drop.
     - For each such call, retrieve its “req” pointer argument with getMemRegionFromExpr.
     - If the req region exists in the ReqStatusMap, update its flag to true (indicating that the cleanup has been performed).

   • checkEndFunction:
     - At function exit, inspect the ReqStatusMap.
     - If any req region still has the cleanup flag set to false, generate a bug report using a PathSensitiveBugReport (or BasicBugReport). The report message should be short and clear (for example: “Resource leak: Missing hwrm_req_drop() on error path”).

3. Implementation Details for Each Callback:
   • In checkPostCall (for hwrm_req_replace):
     - Verify that the callee’s name matches “hwrm_req_replace.”
     - Use EvaluateExprToInt on the return expression and if rc ≠ 0, retrieve the req argument.
     - Update state: add (req region, false) to ReqStatusMap.

   • In checkPreCall (for hwrm_req_drop):
     - Check that the callee’s name equals “hwrm_req_drop.”
     - Extract the req pointer’s MemRegion and inspect the program state (ReqStatusMap).
     - If an entry is found, mark it as cleaned (set the value to true) in the map.

   • In checkEndFunction:
     - Iterate over the entries in ReqStatusMap. For each entry where the cleanup flag is false, trigger a bug report on the corresponding path.
     - Use generateNonFatalErrorNode and create a bug report with a concise message indicating that the error path omitted the cleanup call, leading to a possible resource leak.

This simple three-step approach—tracking the allocation requiring cleanup, marking when cleanup is done, and reporting at function end if cleanup is missing—meets the goal of detecting the bug pattern.
