## Bug Pattern

Error paths that bypass necessary resource cleanup. In this case, if hwrm_req_replace() fails, the code returns immediately without calling hwrm_req_drop() to release the allocated request resource, causing a memory leak. The bug pattern is the failure to perform cleanup actions on error paths, leading to resource leaks when early returns prevent proper deallocation.
