Your plan here

1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a program state map (e.g., ReqCleanupMap) to track allocated request regions. Use
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ReqCleanupMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     where the bool indicates if cleanup (hwrm_req_drop) has been performed.
   • Optionally, if you need to track pointer aliases for the allocation, also register a PtrAliasMap.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • checkPostCall – to intercept calls that allocate or free the request.
   • checkPreStmt – to intercept ReturnStmt nodes and check for leaks on error paths.
   • checkBind – if pointer aliasing needs to be tracked when the request pointer is assigned.

3. Detailed Steps in Callback Implementations:

   a. In checkPostCall:
      – When intercepting a call, check the callee name. For a call to hwrm_req_init:
          • Retrieve the “req” pointer argument from the call.
          • Use getMemRegionFromExpr to extract its MemRegion.
          • Insert the MemRegion into the ReqCleanupMap with a value of false (indicating not yet cleaned).
      – For a call to hwrm_req_drop:
          • Retrieve the pointer argument that is being dropped.
          • Extract its MemRegion.
          • Update ReqCleanupMap for that MemRegion to true, indicating that cleanup has been done.
      – For a call to hwrm_req_replace:
          • If the call returns a non-zero error value (you can evaluate the return value using EvaluateExprToInt on the appropriate expression), then confirm this is an error path.
          • (Optional) You can note in the state that the error branch has been taken for this allocation.

   b. In checkPreStmt for ReturnStmt:
      – At every return point, retrieve the current program state’s ReqCleanupMap.
      – Iterate through the tracked request MemRegions. For any resource that is still marked as not cleaned (false), generate a bug report indicating a potential leak (“Resource not freed on error path”).
      – Use a concise bug message and issue the report with std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport.

   c. (Optional) In checkBind:
      – When the request pointer is bound to another variable, update the PtrAliasMap accordingly so that both the original and alias refer to the same MemRegion.
      – This ensures that if either pointer is cleaned, the state is updated appropriately.

4. Summary:
   – With this approach, whenever a request is allocated using hwrm_req_init, you mark it as “not cleaned.”
   – Then, if hwrm_req_drop is called on that resource (via a successful cleanup call), update its flag.
   – Finally, on any return via checkPreStmt, if an error path is taken without proper cleanup, report the resource leak.
   
This simple plan leverages the provided utility functions along with minimal callbacks to precisely track the allocation and cleanup of the request, and report a bug when a cleanup is missing on an error path.
