## Bug Pattern

Failure to release or clean up an allocated or held resource on an error path. In this patch, if the function hwrm_req_replace() fails, the error path returns immediately without calling hwrm_req_drop() to free or release the pending request, resulting in a potential memory leak. The core issue is neglecting consistent cleanup of resources when an error occurs.
