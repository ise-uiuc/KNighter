1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PendingReqMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will record a request’s memory region and a boolean flag to indicate whether it has been released (true) or is still pending (false).

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. checkPostCall:
     • When a call to hwrm_req_init is intercepted:
         – Check if the callee name equals "hwrm_req_init".
         – Retrieve the pointer (e.g. the req parameter) from the call arguments using getMemRegionFromExpr.
         – Update the PendingReqMap by adding an entry for the region with value false (marked as pending allocation).
     • When a call to hwrm_req_drop is intercepted:
         – Check if the callee name equals "hwrm_req_drop".
         – Retrieve the pointer that is passed to hwrm_req_drop.
         – Update the PendingReqMap for that region: either remove the entry or mark it as true (cleaned-up).

   B. checkEndFunction:
     • In this callback, check when the analysis of bnxt_send_msg ends.
     • Look up the PendingReqMap in the current ProgramState.
     • If any resource (i.e. any req region) is still marked as pending (false), then report a bug.
         – Create a short and clear bug message such as "Missing cleanup call for allocated request: potential memory leak."
         – Use generateNonFatalErrorNode and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport or BasicBugReport with the message.
         
3. Implementation Details:
   • In checkPostCall, compare the callee identifier (using Call.getCalleeIdentifier()->getName()) to decide whether the call is hwrm_req_init or hwrm_req_drop.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr utility function to extract the MemRegion from the given request variable.
   • In checkEndFunction, ensure that you only run this check in the context of bnxt_send_msg (for example, by checking the function name) to avoid false positives.
   • Report only if there exists at least one path where a resource remains unreleased.

This plan uses only two callbacks and one program state map, making it simple to implement while ensuring that the checker precisely detects the error path where resource cleanup is missing.
