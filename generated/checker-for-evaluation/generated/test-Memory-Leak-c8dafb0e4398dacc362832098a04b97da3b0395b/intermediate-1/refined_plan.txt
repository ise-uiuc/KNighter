Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State:
   • Create a mapping to track allocated “request” objects and whether they were properly cleaned. For example, register a program state map:
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(RequestAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
   • The key is the MemRegion* representing the request (obtained from the hwrm_req_init call) and the value is a boolean flag: false if not yet cleaned, true if cleaned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use checkPostCall to intercept calls that initialize, replace, and drop the request.
   • Optionally, use checkEndFunction (or checkEndAnalysis) to catch any leftover allocated requests that remain uncleaned at function exit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Details for Each Callback:

A. In checkPostCall for hwrm_req_init:
   • Identify calls to hwrm_req_init().
   • Retrieve the “req” pointer argument (or the region corresponding to the allocated memory) using getMemRegionFromExpr().
   • If the call is successful (i.e. returns a success code), update the RequestAllocMap by inserting an entry with the request’s region set to false (meaning cleanup pending).

B. In checkPostCall for hwrm_req_drop:
   • Intercept calls to hwrm_req_drop().
   • Retrieve the “req” pointer passed as an argument.
   • Update the RequestAllocMap by marking the corresponding region as cleaned (true). This ensures that even if there are aliases, the state correctly reflects that cleanup occurred.

C. In checkPostCall for hwrm_req_replace:
   • When a call to hwrm_req_replace() is detected, evaluate its return value.
   • If the return value is non-zero (i.e. an error), look up the request pointer argument (using getMemRegionFromExpr() on the appropriate argument).
   • Check the RequestAllocMap. If the region exists and is still marked false (i.e. not cleaned), then report a bug indicating a potential memory leak due to missing cleanup in the error path. The bug report message should be short and clear.

D. (Optional) In checkEndFunction or checkEndAnalysis:
   • At function exit, examine the RequestAllocMap.
   • For any requests that remain uncleaned, emit a diagnostic. This complements the detection in the hwrm_req_replace error path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Reporting:
   • When a potential memory leak is detected (i.e. hwrm_req_replace fails without cleaning up the request), generate an error node and create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a concise message like “Missing cleanup: hwrm_req_drop not called on error path.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
By following these steps you can succinctly track the allocated request and verify that hwrm_req_drop is called in the error path. This plan keeps the implementation simple while making effective use of program state and the appropriate Clang check callbacks.
