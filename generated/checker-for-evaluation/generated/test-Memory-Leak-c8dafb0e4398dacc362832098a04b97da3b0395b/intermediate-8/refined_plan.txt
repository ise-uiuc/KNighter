Your plan is as follows:

—————————————————————————————
1. Customize Program State  
—————————————————————————————
• REGISTER a map called PendingCleanupMap in your program state to track request resources that need cleanup.  
  – Type: REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PendingCleanupMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  – Usage: When hwrm_req_replace returns an error, record the request (req) region as “pending cleanup” (true). When hwrm_req_drop is properly invoked, remove the mapping or mark it as cleaned up.

—————————————————————————————
2. Choose Callback Functions  
—————————————————————————————
a. Use checkPostCall  
  • Detect calls to hwrm_req_replace.  
   – Retrieve the return value of hwrm_req_replace.  
   – If the return value is nonzero (error case), obtain the memory region corresponding to the request argument (e.g., using getMemRegionFromExpr on the req parameter).  
   – Mark that request region in PendingCleanupMap as pending cleanup.  
  • Also, in checkPostCall, detect calls to hwrm_req_drop.  
   – Retrieve the request argument provided to hwrm_req_drop.  
   – If that argument is found in PendingCleanupMap, remove it or mark it as cleaned up.  
    (This ensures that even if the drop call happens later along some code path, your state correctly reflects that cleanup was done.)

b. Use checkEndFunction  
  • At the end of the function, examine the PendingCleanupMap stored in the program state.  
  • If any request region remains marked as pending cleanup (i.e. cleanup was never completed), generate a bug report.  
  • Report message example: “Memory leak: hwrm_req_drop not called on error path”  
   – Use a short bug report message along with a non‐fatal error node.

—————————————————————————————
3. Implementation Details in Each Callback  
—————————————————————————————
• In checkPostCall for hwrm_req_replace:  
  – Confirm the callee’s name equals "hwrm_req_replace".  
  – Evaluate the return value; if nonzero, use getMemRegionFromExpr on the request argument (req) to locate its MemRegion.  
  – Update the program state: add an entry mapping the MemRegion to true (indicating cleanup is pending).  
  – (If needed, use utility function EvaluateExprToInt for evaluating the return value.)

• In checkPostCall for hwrm_req_drop:  
  – Confirm the callee’s name equals "hwrm_req_drop".  
  – Obtain the argument’s MemRegion corresponding to the request.  
  – Update the program state: remove this MemRegion from PendingCleanupMap or mark it as cleaned if you prefer a boolean flag.

• In checkEndFunction:  
  – Retrieve the current program state and the PendingCleanupMap.  
  – If the map is non-empty, iterate over the entries; for each pending cleanup, generate a bug report node (using generateNonFatalErrorNode and std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a clear and short message indicating that hwrm_req_drop was not called before function exit.  
  – The bug report indicates a potential resource leak.

—————————————————————————————
Overall  
—————————————————————————————
• This plan introduces minimal state tracking using PendingCleanupMap.  
• We rely on checkPostCall to record both the error branch (via hwrm_req_replace returning error) and the proper cleanup (via hwrm_req_drop).  
• Finally, checkEndFunction verifies that all allocated request resources have been cleaned up; if not, a bug report is emitted.  

Follow these concrete steps to implement the checker for detecting the pattern of a missing cleanup call (hwrm_req_drop) on error paths.
