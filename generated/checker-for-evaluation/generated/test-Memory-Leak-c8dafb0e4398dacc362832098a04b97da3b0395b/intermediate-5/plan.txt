Your plan is as follows:

1. No specialized program state maps are needed for this bug checker since the resource (i.e. the request allocated via hwrm_req_init) is local and the issue is with not cleaning it up on an error branch. We will detect the mistake by examining the control flow in the function body.

2. Use the following callback functions:
 • checkBranchCondition
 • checkPostStmt for ReturnStmt

3. In checkBranchCondition:
 a. Identify the “if” statement that tests the return value of hwrm_req_replace. You can use the utility function ExprHasName to check that the condition contains “hwrm_req_replace”.
 b. Once you have identified this if condition, examine its then-branch using the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren. Look for a call expression whose callee name is “hwrm_req_drop” (again using ExprHasName or similar string comparison).
 c. If the then-branch does not contain any call to hwrm_req_drop, record this as a bug candidate: the error path returns immediately (or branches) without performing the required cleanup. Report the bug with a short message (for example, “Missing cleanup call: hwrm_req_drop not invoked on error path”).

4. In checkPostStmt:
 a. Additionally, intercept ReturnStmt nodes. For each ReturnStmt, climb upward in the AST (using findSpecificTypeInParents) to look if the ReturnStmt’s corresponding error path resulted from hwrm_req_replace by checking whether the controlling if was seen.
 b. If a ReturnStmt is encountered in such a branch and you cannot detect a preceding hwrm_req_drop call (by searching siblings or parent AST nodes), then generate a bug report.

5. Bug Reporting:
 a. Use a short and clear message—for instance, “Resource leak: Missing hwrm_req_drop cleanup on error path.”
 b. Create and emit the bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

Using this straightforward AST-based checking technique minimizes complexity. You hook the error branch via checkBranchCondition to ensure that when hwrm_req_replace returns an error, there is a corresponding call to hwrm_req_drop before an early return, and you supplement with a ReturnStmt check to catch any missed cases.
