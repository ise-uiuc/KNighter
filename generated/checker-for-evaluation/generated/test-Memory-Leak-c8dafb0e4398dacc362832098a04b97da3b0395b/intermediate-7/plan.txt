1. Customize a program state:
 • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocatedReqMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
  – This map will record any allocated request object (tracked by its MemRegion) that is obtained via hwrm_req_init and mark it as “not cleaned” (false) initially.
  – When a corresponding cleanup (via hwrm_req_drop) is invoked, the flag will be updated (or the entry removed) to indicate that the resource has been released.

2. Use checkPostCall to track relevant function calls:
 a. For hwrm_req_init:
  – In checkPostCall, detect when hwrm_req_init is called.
  – Retrieve the request pointer argument (i.e. the “req” value) using a utility like getMemRegionFromExpr.
  – If hwrm_req_init returns successfully (you may also check the return code if needed), add the request’s MemRegion to AllocatedReqMap with a value false (meaning “not yet cleaned”).
 b. For hwrm_req_drop:
  – In checkPostCall, intercept calls to hwrm_req_drop.
  – Obtain the pointer (req) passed to hwrm_req_drop.
  – Update the AllocatedReqMap by marking that MemRegion as cleaned (or remove its entry), indicating that the resource has been freed.

3. Use checkEndFunction (or checkPreStmt for ReturnStmt) to detect resource leaks:
 • In checkEndFunction, at the end of bnxt_send_msg, examine the program state.
 • Iterate over the AllocatedReqMap for the current function context. For any entry that remains in an “uncleaned” state (i.e. flagged false), it means that an allocation (for example from hwrm_req_init) was not properly released before returning.
 • Generate a bug report using a simple error message (such as “Resource leak: allocated request not freed on error path”) via a call to std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport.

4. (Optional) For pointer aliasing:
 • Although simple direct tracking might suffice here, if you suspect that the req pointer is passed to an alias, you can declare another map via REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*).
 • In checkBind, record when one pointer is assigned from another so that if one gets cleaned the alias can be updated too.
 • This step is optional if the analysis of the req pointer is straightforward.

Following these concrete steps with careful utility function usage will let you easily trace the allocation (via hwrm_req_init) and ensure that before any error return (especially when hwrm_req_replace fails) the cleanup function (hwrm_req_drop) is called.
