1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • REGISTER a program state map (e.g., using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) called ReqCleanupMap that maps the “req” MemRegion (the allocated request resource) to a boolean flag. The flag indicates whether the resource is pending cleanup (true means cleanup is required). You do not need to track pointer aliases for this simple single‐resource scenario.

2. Choose callback functions and implement each step as follows:

   a. In checkPostCall for hwrm_req_replace:
      • Intercept calls to hwrm_req_replace.
      • Evaluate the returned error code (using EvaluateExprToInt on the call result) to see if it is nonzero (i.e., an error).
      • If an error is detected, retrieve the request pointer argument (for example, the second parameter “req”) by examining the call arguments.
      • Look up the MemRegion corresponding to this “req” (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and add an entry into your ReqCleanupMap with a flag set to true, indicating that this request should be cleaned up.

   b. In checkPostCall for hwrm_req_drop:
      • Intercept calls to hwrm_req_drop.
      • Retrieve the “req” pointer argument passed to hwrm_req_drop.
      • Obtain its associated MemRegion and then update the ReqCleanupMap by either removing the entry or marking the cleanup flag as false (i.e., cleaned up).
      
   c. In checkEndFunction (or checkEndAnalysis if you prefer to check after all paths are explored):
      • At function end, inspect the program state (ReqCleanupMap) for any entries whose flag is still true.
      • For each pending resource cleanup, generate a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport) with a short message such as “Missing hwrm_req_drop on error path – potential memory leak.”
      • This indicates that on an error path (detected by hwrm_req_replace returning an error), the allocated or held request resource was not properly released.

3. Summary of callback usage:
   • checkPostCall:
       – For hwrm_req_replace: mark “req” in ReqCleanupMap when an error is detected.
       – For hwrm_req_drop: update ReqCleanupMap to mark that the resource has been cleaned up.
   • checkEndFunction (or checkEndAnalysis):
       – Walk through the ReqCleanupMap and report any leak if cleanup remains pending.

Each step is concrete and relies on the provided utility functions (like EvaluateExprToInt and getMemRegionFromExpr) to ease the implementation. This simple state tracking and end-of-function check is sufficient to flag the error path where resource cleanup is omitted.
