1. Customize Program States:
   - Register a program state map (e.g. FirmwareInitMap) to track the initialization check status of firmware pointers. Use:
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FirmwareInitMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     This map will associate the memory region of a firmware pointer with a boolean indicating whether it has been NULL-checked (true if checked, false if not).
   - Also register a pointer alias map (e.g. PtrAliasMap) to record alias relationships between pointer variables. This ensures that if one alias is checked in a branch, the check propagates to its aliases.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   a. checkPostCall:
      - Intercept calls to request_firmware. Detect if the callee is "request_firmware". From the call event, retrieve the first argument (the firmware pointer’s address) and use getMemRegionFromExpr to obtain its MemRegion.
      - Record the pointer in FirmwareInitMap with a false value (indicating that no NULL check has been performed). This establishes that the firmware pointer initialized by request_firmware is in an unchecked state.
      
   b. checkBranchCondition:
      - Intercept branch conditions. In this callback, examine conditions that perform a check on the firmware pointer. For example, detect patterns like if (!fw) or if (fw == NULL). You can use the utility function ExprHasName to see if the condition involves the target firmware pointer.
      - Once such a pointer is identified, update the program state (FirmwareInitMap) for that pointer (and its aliases via PtrAliasMap) to true, indicating that a proper check (the return value is considered) has been performed.
      
   c. checkPreCall:
      - Intercept calls to release_firmware. In this callback, when a call to release_firmware is detected, retrieve its pointer argument (the firmware pointer) using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      - Look up this pointer’s MemRegion in FirmwareInitMap. If the state is false (i.e. no check was made), then report a bug by emitting a short and clear bug report (e.g., "Unchecked firmware initialization") by calling generateNonFatalErrorNode or C.emitReport.
      
   d. checkBind:
      - In the checkBind callback, track aliasing information. When a firmware pointer gets assigned to another pointer variable, record the aliasing relationship in PtrAliasMap.
      - Ensure that if one pointer becomes checked (via the branch condition), then its aliases in the state map are also updated accordingly.

3. Bug Reporting:
   - When an unchecked firmware pointer is about to be used (for example, being passed to release_firmware) and remains flagged as not checked, create and emit a bug report with a concise message such as "Unchecked firmware initialization: pointer may be uninitialized." Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to construct the bug report.

Following these steps will enable you to write a checker that catches the failure to check the return value of request_firmware, thereby preventing the use of an uninitialized pointer.
