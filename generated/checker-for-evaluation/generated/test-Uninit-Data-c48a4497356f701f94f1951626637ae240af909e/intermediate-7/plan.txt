1. Customize the Program State:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(RequestFwMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
   • Use this map to record the firmware pointer (the output parameter from request_firmware()) as “unverified” (true) after the call.

2. Track the request_firmware() Call (using checkPostCall):
   • In the checkPostCall callback, intercept each call.
   • Check if the callee’s name is "request_firmware".
   • Retrieve the first argument (which is the address of the firmware pointer) and use getMemRegionFromExpr to obtain its underlying memory region.
   • Record that region in RequestFwMap, marking it as coming from a request_firmware() call.

3. Detect the Improper If-Check (using checkBranchCondition):
   • In the checkBranchCondition callback, examine the condition expression of the if statement.
   • Search the expression tree (with methods like findSpecificTypeInChildren) for a DeclRefExpr that refers to a pointer variable.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr on that sub-expression to get its MemRegion.
   • Check if this region exists in RequestFwMap. If yes, that means the branch condition is testing the firmware pointer directly rather than checking the return value.
   • If such a case is detected, generate a bug report using a concise message like "Unchecked return value of request_firmware()".

4. (Optional) Clean Up the State:
   • When the pointer is properly checked (for example, if an assignment or a different value is used later), update or remove the entry in RequestFwMap to avoid duplicate warnings.

This plan uses the simplest approach: it records the pointer written by request_firmware(), and then flags any branch condition that checks that pointer directly. This ensures that if the programmer checks the pointer (e.g., "if (!fw)") instead of verifying the returned error code, a warning is issued.
