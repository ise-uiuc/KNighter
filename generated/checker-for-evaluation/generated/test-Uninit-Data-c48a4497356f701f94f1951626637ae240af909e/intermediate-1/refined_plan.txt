Your plan here

1. Customize Program State:
   • Define a mapping using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FWInitMap, const MemRegion*, bool) where each firmware pointer’s memory region is mapped to a flag indicating whether its return value has been checked (true if checked, false if not).

2. Choose and Implement Callback Functions:

   a. checkPostCall (to track the firmware API call):
      • Intercept call events.
      • If the callee’s name is "request_firmware":
         – Use helper functions (such as findSpecificTypeInParents) to inspect if the call is part of an assignment (i.e. its return value is bound to a variable).
         – If the return value is not assigned (i.e. it is not being stored into an integer variable), obtain the region of the first argument (the pointer to the firmware variable) by calling getMemRegionFromExpr.
         – Update FWInitMap for the retrieved memory region with false (unchecked).
         
   b. checkBranchCondition (to mark the firmware pointer as checked):
      • Intercept branch conditions.
      • Inspect the condition expression to see if it compares the firmware pointer with NULL (for example: if (!fw), if (fw == NULL), or similar patterns).
      • Use the helper function ExprHasName to confirm that the expression text contains the firmware variable name.
      • Retrieve the firmware pointer’s region using getMemRegionFromExpr and update FWInitMap for that region to true, marking that a proper check has been performed.

   c. checkPreCall (to catch the improper use at release):
      • Intercept call events.
      • If the callee’s name is "release_firmware":
         – Retrieve the region of the passed firmware pointer argument using getMemRegionFromExpr.
         – Consult the FWInitMap in the current program state. If the region is present and its flag is false (meaning the firmware pointer was never checked properly), generate a bug report.
         – Use a short and clear message (e.g. "Firmware pointer not checked for request failure") when creating the bug report through std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

3. Pointer/State Aliasing Considerations:
   • If needed, incorporate a PtrAliasMap (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) in checkBind to track alias information. When one alias is marked as checked (via checkBranchCondition), update the mapping for its aliases accordingly.
   • In the simplest implementation, ensuring the correct region is obtained via getMemRegionFromExpr in each callback should suffice.

By following these steps in the respective callback functions, you will detect instances where request_firmware is called without checking its return value—leading to an uninitialized firmware pointer later used in release_firmware or similar function calls.
