1. Use a program state map to track whether the firmware pointer has been NULL-checked. Register a map using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FirmwareCheckedMap, const MemRegion *, bool). In this map, a firmware region is initially marked as unchecked (false) when returned from request_firmware.

2. In the checkPostCall callback, intercept any call to request_firmware:
   • Check if the callee’s name is "request_firmware".
   • Retrieve the first argument (the pointer-to-firmware) from the call event. Use getMemRegionFromExpr to extract the underlying MemRegion.
   • Update the FirmwareCheckedMap to record that this firmware pointer (MemRegion) is unchecked (false).
   • (Optionally, use checkBind to record any aliasing if the firmware pointer is later assigned to another variable.)

3. In the checkBranchCondition callback, examine the condition expressions:
   • If the condition involves the firmware pointer—for example, by using ExprHasName to check if "fw" appears in the condition text, or by detecting a null comparison—then update the FirmwareCheckedMap entry corresponding to the firmware pointer’s MemRegion to true. This indicates that the pointer has been properly checked.
   • The update should use a helper function that marks the pointer (and its aliases from PtrAliasMap, if necessary) as checked in FirmwareCheckedMap.

4. In the checkPreCall callback, intercept calls that use the firmware pointer (for example, calls to release_firmware):
   • Retrieve the argument to release_firmware.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr to get its corresponding MemRegion.
   • Look up the region in FirmwareCheckedMap. If the firmware pointer is still marked as unchecked (false), then it is being used without the proper error check.
   • If such a usage is detected, emit a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short message like "Uninitialized firmware pointer used without error check."

5. (Optional) Use checkBind to track aliasing relationships so that if a firmware pointer is copied to another pointer variable, the NULL-check status propagates.

This plan uses few steps and makes use of available utility functions (like getMemRegionFromExpr and ExprHasName) to detect the lack of error value checking for firmware pointers returned from request_firmware.
