## Bug Pattern

Failure to check the return code from a function (request_firmware) that initializes a pointer, which results in using an uninitialized variable. This pattern leads to dereferencing or releasing an invalid pointer (in this case, calling release_firmware(fw)) when the initialization fails, thereby causing potential runtime errors.
