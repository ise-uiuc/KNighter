## Bug Pattern

The pattern is failing to check the return value of an initialization function (i.e., request_firmware) before using its out-parameter. In this case, if firmware loading fails, the firmware pointer remains uninitialized, yet the code proceeds to test and even call release_firmware() on it. This unguarded use of an uninitialized pointer can lead to undefined behavior.
