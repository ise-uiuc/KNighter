Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program States

• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FwStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  – Use this to record firmware pointers that come from a request_firmware call which did not have its return value checked (mark them as “unchecked”).

• (Optional) REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)  
  – Use this to propagate “unchecked” status when a firmware pointer is copied via an assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Implementation Details

A. In checkPostCall (for function calls):

• Target request_firmware:  
  – In the checkPostCall callback, when you intercept a call, check if Call.getCalleeName() equals "request_firmware".  
  – Use findSpecificTypeInParents() (or a similar AST inspection) to see if the call result is assigned to a variable.  
    • If the request_firmware call is not part of an assignment (i.e. its return value is unused), then this is our first sign of error.
  – Retrieve the out-parameter (the first argument) using Call.getArg(0), then use getMemRegionFromExpr() to obtain its memory region.
  – Record this region in FwStateMap with the value false (meaning “unchecked return value”).

------------------------------------------------------------
B. In checkPreCall (for subsequent calls):

• Target release_firmware:  
  – In the checkPreCall callback, when you intercept a call to release_firmware (i.e. Call.getCalleeName() equals "release_firmware"), extract its first argument.
  – Retrieve its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr().
  – Query FwStateMap with that region:  
    • If the region is present and still marked false (unchecked), then this indicates that request_firmware’s error return was not utilized before the pointer was used.
  – Emit a bug report (e.g., using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a short message such as "Unchecked request_firmware: firmware pointer uninitialized") and generate a non-fatal error node.

------------------------------------------------------------
C. In checkBind (for pointer aliasing):

• Propagate aliasing for the firmware pointer:
  – When a binding occurs (e.g. p2 = p1), in checkBind, check if p1’s MemRegion exists in FwStateMap.
  – If so, add an entry for the new pointer (p2) in FwStateMap with the same unchecked status.
  – Also, update the PtrAliasMap if needed so that later checks on any alias will trigger the bug report.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of the Workflow

• When request_firmware is called, detect if its return value is not assigned.  
  – If not, record the firmware pointer (from the out-parameter) as “unchecked.”

• Later, when release_firmware is called on that same firmware pointer (or one of its aliases), the checker will look up FwStateMap.  
  – If the pointer is still marked as unchecked, report a bug indicating that the return value of request_firmware was not checked before use.

------------------------------------------------------------
This simple plan uses two callback functions (checkPostCall for detection, checkPreCall for reporting) and a pointer alias propagation via checkBind. Follow these concrete steps to implement a clean checker that highlights the bug pattern of using an uninitialized firmware pointer when the initialization function’s return value is not properly checked.
