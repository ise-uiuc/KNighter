1. Customizing Program States  
   • REGISTER a program state map called FreedPtrMap (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) of type (const MemRegion*, bool). This map will record for each pointer’s memory region whether it has been freed (true if already freed; false otherwise).  

2. Choosing Callback Functions  
   a. checkPostCall  
      – Intercept call events.  
      – In checkPostCall, check if the callee is kfree.  
      – Retrieve the function argument (i.e. the pointer passed to kfree) and get its associated memory region (using getMemRegionFromExpr()).  
      – Query the FreedPtrMap:  
         ▪ If the region is already marked as freed (true), then report a bug with a short message (e.g., "Double free detected").  
         ▪ Otherwise, update the state by marking the region as freed (set the mapping to true).  

   b. checkBind  
      – Intercept pointer assignments.  
      – When a pointer variable is (re)assigned, inspect the right-hand side.  
      – If the RHS is a NULL constant (or an expression that clearly reinitializes the pointer to NULL), update FreedPtrMap for that pointer’s memory region: either mark it as not freed (false) or erase the entry.  
      – This ensures that if the pointer is properly reinitialized after a free, it no longer appears as already freed.  
      – Also, use pointer alias tracking via a state map (e.g., PtrAliasMap) so that if a pointer is reinitialized to NULL, all its aliases are updated accordingly.  

3. Bug Reporting  
   • In checkPostCall, when finding a kfree call on a pointer that is already freed, create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>. Keep the message “Double free detected” as short and clear.  

4. Implementation Details  
   – In checkPostCall:  
     1. Identify the function name from the CallEvent; check if it equals “kfree”.  
     2. Retrieve the pointer argument and extract its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.  
     3. Look up this region in FreedPtrMap.  
     4. If the pointer is marked freed, generate the bug report; otherwise, mark it as freed.  

   – In checkBind:  
     1. Inspect binding statements where a pointer variable is assigned a value.  
     2. If the RHS is determined (e.g., via EvaluateExprToInt for a NULL integer constant or other methods) to be NULL, then update FreedPtrMap to clear any freed marker.  
     3. Also, update the PtrAliasMap if used, so that all aliases of the pointer get the same update.  

Following these steps – customizing your program state with FreedPtrMap, using checkPostCall to catch calls to kfree on already freed pointers, and using checkBind to clear the “freed” flag when a pointer is reinitialized – will allow you to detect the targeted bug pattern of a pointer not being reset after being freed, which may lead to a double free.
