Your plan here

1. Decide if it's necessary to customize program states  
   • In this checker, we do not need to customize program states (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) for pointer aliasing or other tracking because our bug pattern is based solely on validating the length (optlen) against a fixed copy size.  
   • We only need to perform a simple constant evaluation on the function call parameters, so no additional state maps are required.

2. Choose callback functions  
   • Use checkPreCall to inspect every function call.  
   • Do not use branch or bind callbacks here because there is no pointer aliasing or conditional testing of a pointer value; the main check is performed directly at the call site of copy_from_sockptr.

3. Detailed implementation steps in the checkPreCall callback  

   a. First, in checkPreCall, check if the call is made to copy_from_sockptr by retrieving the callee identifier from the CallEvent.  
      • Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare the name with "copy_from_sockptr".  
      • If the name does not match, simply return.

   b. If the call is to copy_from_sockptr, extract the call arguments relating to the copy operation:  
      • Identify the third argument as the fixed size argument (expected copy size) provided to copy_from_sockptr.  
      • Identify the fourth argument as the user-supplied length (optlen).  

   c. Evaluate both expressions to determine their constant integer values:  
      • Use EvaluateExprToInt on the expected copy size (third argument).  
      • Use EvaluateExprToInt on the optlen argument (fourth argument).  
      • If either cannot be evaluated as an integer constant, then skip the analysis for this call (since the length cannot be determined statically).

   d. Compare the evaluated integers:  
      • If the user-supplied optlen is less than the expected copy size, then we have detected a bug pattern where the user request length is not properly validated against the fixed byte copy size.  
      • In that case, create a bug report.  
         - Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short and clear message (e.g., "Unchecked user input length in copy_from_sockptr call") to warn the developer.  

   e. Finally, emit the bug report using the CheckerContext (e.g., C.emitReport(...)).

4. Summary  
   • Since our bug has a simple numerical comparison nature, we can use checkPreCall without additional state management.  
   • We rely on EvaluateExprToInt to extract compile-time constant values from the copy size and the user-provided length.  
   • This checker is implemented by intercepting calls to copy_from_sockptr, then comparing its fixed copy size parameter with the user-supplied optlen value.  
   • If optlen is less than the fixed size, the bug report is generated indicating a potential memory overread.

Following these steps will let you implement a straightforward checker that detects the failure to validate the user input length before copying data from user space.
