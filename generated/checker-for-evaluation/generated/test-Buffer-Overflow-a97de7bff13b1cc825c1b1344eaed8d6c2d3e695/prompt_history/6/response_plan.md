Your plan here
1. No custom program state is necessary for this checker since tracking state across different statements or pointer aliasing is not required. We only need to intercept specific function call events.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to detect the bug pattern:
  a. In checkPreCall, examine every CallEvent.
  b. Get the callee’s name using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare it with "copy_from_sockptr" (use getNameAsString() if needed).
  c. If a call to copy_from_sockptr is detected, check the number and types of arguments. In the buggy code the function is called with only three arguments, meaning that the user-supplied buffer length (optlen) is not validated.
  d. Optionally, for additional safety, ensure that this call occurs within functions related to setting socket options (e.g. inside rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old or rfcomm_sock_setsockopt). This contextual check can be done by upward traversing the AST (using findSpecificTypeInParents) to find the enclosing FunctionDecl and then inspecting its name.

3. Issue a bug report:
  a. If the checker confirms that copy_from_sockptr is invoked without first validating that the user-supplied buffer length (optlen) is at least equal to the required destination buffer size, generate a non‐fatal error node.
  b. Create and emit a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short and clear message such as "User buffer length not validated" to indicate the potential for slab-out-of-bounds access.

4. Leverage utility functions as needed:
  a. Use ExprHasName if deciding to compare macro or function names from source text.
  b. Use the upward AST inspection utility findSpecificTypeInParents to locate the enclosing function declaration when validating context.

This simple, single-callback approach intercepts calls to the unvalidated copy_from_sockptr call and reports the bug pattern in a clear and concise manner.
