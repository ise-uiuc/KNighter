Your plan here

1. No need to customize the program state for this checker.
   
2. Use the call-back function checkPostCall to inspect function call events.

3. In checkPostCall:
   • For every call event, get the callee’s identifier and use getNameAsString() to check if the function being called is "copy_from_sockptr".
   • Once a call to copy_from_sockptr is detected, this indicates that the user input length is not validated before copying data from user space.
   • (Optionally) Verify that the call’s arguments include the target buffer and the expected copy size. However, for simplicity, reporting on any usage of copy_from_sockptr in the context of sock options (i.e. inside rfcomm_sock_setsockopt(_old)) is sufficient.
   
4. Report the bug:
   • Create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short, clear message such as "Unvalidated user input length in copy_from_sockptr".
   • Generate a non-fatal error node so that the report is emitted.
   
5. (Optional) Use the utility function ExprHasName if needed to double-check that the source text contains the target function name, ensuring we have not mistakenly picked another similar function.

This approach, using the simple checkPostCall callback and string comparison on the callee’s name, meets the requirements for detecting the bug pattern.
