Your plan here

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • For this bug pattern, no extra program state is needed since the goal is to flag calls to the unsafe copy function without validating the length.
   • We do not need to track pointer aliases or taint tags.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept function calls.
   • Use checkASTDecl (or alternatively checkASTCodeBody) if you want to further restrict the checker to the targeted file or function names, but this is optional—checking the callee name at call time is sufficient.

3. Implementing the checker – detailed steps:

   a. In the checkPreCall callback:
      • Check if the call’s callee identifier matches "copy_from_sockptr" (using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and comparing its name with "copy_from_sockptr").
      • If it does not, then do nothing and return.
      
   b. Restrict the context:
      • Optionally, use information from the CheckerContext to verify that the call is occurring within a function known to handle RFCOMM socket options (e.g. function name contains "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old" or "rfcomm_sock_setsockopt"). You can traverse upward in the AST using findSpecificTypeInParents<> if needed.
      
   c. Validate the copy size versus length:
      • Retrieve the arguments of the call event. In the buggy code, copy_from_sockptr is called with the expected size (third argument). Use EvaluateExprToInt on this argument to get the expected size.
      • Although the proper fix uses an additional parameter (optlen) that is checked before copying, the unsafe call does not explicitly compare optlen against the expected size.
      • Try to locate (in the current function’s parameters) the value corresponding to user-supplied length (likely named “optlen”) by traversing the function parameters or parent context. If you can successfully evaluate it, then check whether its value is at least the expected copy size.
      • If the evaluated user input length is less than the required size (or if there is no sufficient check), then mark this as a bug scenario.
      • In the simplest approach, if you cannot determine the correct user input length check (or as soon as you see the unsafe call pattern), report the bug immediately since the pattern indicates that no proper validation was performed.

   d. Reporting the bug:
      • Generate an error node and create a bug report with a short and clear message (for example, “unsafe user input: unvalidated optlen in copy_from_sockptr”).
      • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> as needed and emit the report through CheckerContext.

4. Summary of the implementation steps:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept any call where the callee is "copy_from_sockptr".
   • (Optionally) Ensure the call occurs within RFCOMM setsockopt functions by examining the enclosing function’s name.
   • Retrieve and evaluate the expected size argument of the call.
   • Attempt to identify the optlen (user input length) from the function parameters. If either the optlen is not verified to be at least the expected size or if such a check is absent, report a bug.
   • Emit a short, clear bug report indicating that a user-supplied input length is not properly validated before copying.

Following these concrete steps with the available utility functions (e.g. getNameAsString on identifiers, EvaluateExprToInt, and findSpecificTypeInParents) will allow you to implement a simple and effective checker for this bug pattern.
