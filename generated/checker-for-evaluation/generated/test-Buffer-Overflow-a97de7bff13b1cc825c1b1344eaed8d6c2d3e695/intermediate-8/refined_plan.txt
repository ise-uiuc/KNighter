Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Customized Program State

• REGISTER a map to record whether an optlen value has been validated. For example, use
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ValidatedOptlenMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
This will track the memory region for the “optlen” argument and whether a branch condition has compared it against an expected size.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Their Implementation

A. checkBranchCondition

 • Purpose: Capture and analyze any “if” conditions where the user-supplied optlen is compared against a constant size.
 • Implementation:
  – In the checkBranchCondition callback, examine the condition’s AST.
  – Use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the condition’s source text contains “optlen”.
  – If a comparison is detected (e.g. “optlen >= sizeof(u32)” or “optlen >= sizeof(sec)”), try to extract the constant value used in the comparison.
  – Use EvaluateExprToInt on the other operand of the comparison if it is a constant.
  – Identify the MemRegion corresponding to “optlen” by walking upward in the AST (e.g., via findSpecificTypeInParents) and then calling getMemRegionFromExpr.
  – If the condition shows that the passed optlen is at least as large as the expected copy length, update ValidatedOptlenMap state for that optlen region as “true”.

B. checkPreCall

 • Purpose: Intercept calls to copy_from_sockptr and check if an unsafe copy is being made without prior validation.
 • Implementation:
  – In checkPreCall, check if the callee’s name is “copy_from_sockptr”.
  – If so, extract the arguments: its third parameter (copy length) is the expected number of bytes to copy.
  – Use EvaluateExprToInt to compute the constant expected_size from the third argument.
  – For this call site, get the optlen value indirectly. For example, use findSpecificTypeInParents or inspect the surrounding code to identify an expression/DeclRefExpr named “optlen” (using utility function ExprHasName).
  – Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the optlen expression to obtain its region.
  – Then retrieve the current value from ValidatedOptlenMap for that region.
  – If the optlen is not marked as “validated” (or not found in the map) and the expected copy size is not checked against it, report a bug.
  – Generate a short warning using a bug report (e.g. with std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) stating: “User buffer optlen not validated for copy_from_sockptr.”

C. (Optional) checkBind

 • Purpose: If pointer aliasing is a concern (e.g. if optlen is passed indirectly via an alias), use checkBind.
 • Implementation:
  – Use a program state map such as PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) to track aliases of the optlen parameter.
  – In checkBind, when an alias of optlen is established, insert the mapping.
  – In checkBranchCondition and checkPreCall, consult the PtrAliasMap to also update or query validation status through the alias relationship.
  – (Note that this step is only necessary if the optlen analysis requires tracking aliasing; otherwise you can simplify by focusing on the direct expression.)

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of Steps

• Step 1: Define and register a ValidatedOptlenMap state to mark when an “optlen” argument has been sufficiently validated by branch conditions.
• Step 2: In checkBranchCondition, inspect every branch condition to see if “optlen” is compared to an expected constant (e.g., sizeof(u32) or sizeof(sec)). When a valid comparison is found, mark the optlen’s memory region in the ValidatedOptlenMap.
• Step 3: In checkPreCall, intercept any calls to copy_from_sockptr.
  – Retrieve the expected copy length from the third parameter.
  – Locate the optlen expression in the surrounding code, obtain its mem region, and check the ValidatedOptlenMap.
  – If the optlen variable is not validated against the expected size, emit a bug report with the message “User buffer optlen not validated for copy_from_sockptr.”

• (Optional) Step 4: In checkBind, track aliasing of optlen if necessary by updating a PtrAliasMap.

------------------------------------------------------------
This plan uses the simplest approach with minimal steps: one map for optlen validation, two callbacks (checkBranchCondition and checkPreCall) to capture the relevant checking and copying events, and optionally checkBind for pointer aliases. Follow these concrete steps to implement a checker that detects the unvalidated copy_from_sockptr usage.
