## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the failure to validate the length of user-supplied input before copying data from user space into kernel buffers. In the original code, the use of copy_from_sockptr() assumed that the provided length (optlen) was sufficient to cover the expected size. Without verifying that the user input is at least as large as the target structure, the code risks reading out-of-bounds memory, leading to potential security issues such as slab-overflows. The fix replaces the copying function with one (bt_copy_from_sockptr()) that explicitly validates the provided input size against the expected size. This emphasizes the necessity of proper input length checking when transferring data from user space to kernel space to prevent memory corruption or leakage.
