1. No customized program states are needed for this bug pattern since no pointer aliasing or taint tracking is required.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept every function call.

   • In checkPreCall, examine the callee identifier. If the callee name is "copy_from_sockptr" (and not "bt_copy_from_sockptr"), then the call is a potential violation of the length validation.

   • Retrieve the function context by using findSpecificTypeInParents<FunctionDecl>(S, C) to check if the call occurs inside a socket option setting function (for example, “rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old” or “rfcomm_sock_setsockopt”). This helps narrow down the bug pattern to relevant code regions.

   • Although the expected size (e.g. sizeof(u32) or sizeof(sec)) is passed as a constant to copy_from_sockptr, the bug pattern arises because the user-supplied buffer length (optlen) is not independently verified against this expected size. If possible, use EvaluateExprToInt on the argument representing the expected size to extract its integer value. (Note: If optlen is not available directly via the copy_from_sockptr call arguments, then using the function context is sufficient.)

3. When a call to copy_from_sockptr is detected within a setsockopt function, immediately issue a bug report since the user-supplied buffer length is not being validated.

   • Use a short message like "User-supplied buffer length not validated."

   • Create the bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> and generate a non‐fatal error node.

This simple, step-by-step approach in checkPreCall will allow you to flag any use of copy_from_sockptr in a context where proper length validation is absent, fulfilling the checker’s goal in a clear and concise manner.
