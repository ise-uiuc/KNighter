1. Decide on Program State:
   • No custom program state maps are needed since we are only comparing constant sizes with a runtime “optlen” argument.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept calls at the point where memory is copied from user space.
   
3. Implementation Details in checkPreCall:
   a. In checkPreCall, determine if the call event is a call to the memory-copy helper that includes the optlen parameter—in our case “bt_copy_from_sockptr”. (Also consider handling “copy_from_sockptr” if needed, but its signature does not involve optlen.)
   b. Retrieve the callee name using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare it with "bt_copy_from_sockptr".
   c. If the call matches, extract the expected copy size from argument index 1. (For example, in bt_copy_from_sockptr(&dest, size, optval, optlen), the expected size is in argument 1.)
   d. Extract the user-provided length (optlen) from argument index 3.
   e. Use the utility function EvaluateExprToInt on both arguments to obtain their integer values.
   f. If both evaluations succeed, compare the evaluated values. If the user-provided length is less than the expected size, it indicates that the input length is insufficient.
   g. In that case, generate a bug report by creating a non‐fatal error node and emitting a bug report (for instance, using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short message such as "Invalid optlen: insufficient user input length".

4. Summary:
   • The checker intercepts calls to bt_copy_from_sockptr in checkPreCall.
   • It then extracts and evaluates the expected copy size and the provided optlen parameter.
   • If the optlen does not meet the minimum expected size, the checker reports the bug.
   • No pointer alias tracking or additional program state is required for this check.

Following these detailed steps should help you implement the checker to detect the bug pattern of copying memory with an insufficient user-provided length.
