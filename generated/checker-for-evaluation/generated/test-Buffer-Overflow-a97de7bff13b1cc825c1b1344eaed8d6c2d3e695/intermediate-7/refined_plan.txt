Your plan here

1. No custom program state maps are needed for this checker because this bug pattern only involves detecting an unchecked length parameter in calls to a specific function.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to inspect each function call:
   • In checkPreCall, first determine if the callee’s name is "copy_from_sockptr" by using the utility function ExprHasName (or by checking the callee identifier’s name).
   • If the function name matches, then examine the call’s arguments. In the buggy code, copy_from_sockptr is used without a length check (i.e. it only takes three parameters). In contrast, the safe function (bt_copy_from_sockptr) accepts a fourth parameter with the user-provided length.
   • Verify the number of arguments in the call event. If it has three parameters (or shows any signature mismatch that indicates the absence of user input length validation), then mark this call as problematic.

3. Report the bug once the inappropriate call is detected:
   • Use a concise bug report (for example, via std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport) with a short message like "Unchecked user input length in copy_from_sockptr."
   • Emit the report to alert the user of the potential slab-out-of-bounds issue.

Following these concrete steps in checkPreCall should enable you to detect when copy_from_sockptr is used without proper validation of the user-provided length, achieving the goal of this checker.
