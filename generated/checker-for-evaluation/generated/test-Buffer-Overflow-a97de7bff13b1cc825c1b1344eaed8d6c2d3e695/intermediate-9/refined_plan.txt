1. Determine if custom program states are needed  
 • In this checker we do not need any additional state maps (e.g. for pointer aliasing or tainting) because the bug pattern can be detected solely by examining each call to copy_from_sockptr and comparing its fixed size argument with the caller’s provided length.  

2. Choose the callback functions  
 • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept all function calls.  
 • (Optionally) Use checkASTDecl or checkASTCodeBody to limit the analysis to functions containing setsockopt logic if desired.

3. Implement the checkPreCall callback  
 a. Detect calls to copy_from_sockptr  
  – In checkPreCall, check if the callee’s name equals "copy_from_sockptr".  
 b. Extract and evaluate the fixed-size argument  
  – Retrieve the third argument of the call (the expected copy size) and use EvaluateExprToInt to obtain its constant integer value.  
 c. Identify the user-supplied length parameter  
  – Walk upward in the AST (using findSpecificTypeInParents or by other means) to locate the function’s parameters.  
  – Find the parameter named "optlen" (or locate the corresponding argument in the caller function’s signature).  
 d. Infer the maximum value for the optlen parameter  
  – Using the SymbolRef from the optlen expression (retrieved from its DeclRefExpr), call inferSymbolMaxVal to obtain the maximum user-provided length.  
 e. Compare the evaluated expected size with the available length  
  – If the inferred maximum value for optlen is known and is less than the fixed size extracted in step (b), then this indicates a possible out-of-bounds copy.  
 f. Report a bug  
  – Generate a non‐fatal error node and issue a bug report with a clear, short message (for example, “Unchecked copy_from_sockptr: optlen may be too small”) by instantiating a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport.

4. Summary of implementation steps  
 • In checkPreCall:  
  1. Check the function callee’s name via Call.getCalleeIdentifier().  
  2. If it is "copy_from_sockptr", extract the third argument (the size argument) and attempt to evaluate it to an integer using EvaluateExprToInt.  
  3. Locate the optlen parameter in the surrounding function (possibly via an upward AST search or by examining the current function scope) and acquire its underlying SymbolRef.  
  4. Use inferSymbolMaxVal to get the maximum value available for optlen.  
  5. If this maximum value is less than the fixed size, report a potential out-of-bounds copy bug.  

This concise plan integrates the provided utility functions and uses the simplest approach with checkPreCall to detect when the copying operation is performed without proper validation of the user-supplied length.
