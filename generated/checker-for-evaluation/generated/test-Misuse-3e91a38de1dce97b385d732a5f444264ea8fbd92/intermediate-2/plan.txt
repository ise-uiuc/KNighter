Your plan here

1. Callback Registration and Selection:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback function. In this callback, intercept each function call.
   • No need for custom program state maps because the bug pattern does not require tracking pointer aliases or taint tracking.

2. Identify the Problematic Function:
   • In checkPreCall, check if the callee identifier equals "memdup_user". Use getNameAsString() on the CallEvent’s callee identifier.
   • If it is not "memdup_user", then ignore the call.

3. Inspect the Arguments:
   • Once a call to memdup_user is detected, focus on its second argument (the size parameter).
   • Use AST utilities (for example, findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator> on the second argument’s expression) to determine whether the size is computed using a multiplication operation.
   • Optionally, use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the textual representation of the size argument contains characters like "*" or even specific literals (e.g., "256") to indicate it’s a multiplication for an array copy.
   • Although the check is straightforward, keep it simple: if the size expression is a multiplication expression, it likely is calculating “count * sizeof(element)” without built‐in overflow checking.

4. Report the Bug:
   • If the call to memdup_user with a multiplication-based size argument is found, generate a bug report.
   • Use a short but clear message like “Use memdup_array_user() for safe array copying” by creating a bug report with std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport).
   • Emit the report using the CheckerContext’s diagnostic mechanism.

Each step is concrete:
   – In checkPreCall, first compare the function name.
   – Then, analyze the second argument’s AST to see if it uses a multiplication expression.
   – Finally, issue a report if the condition is met. This simple, few-step approach should be easy to implement and follow.
