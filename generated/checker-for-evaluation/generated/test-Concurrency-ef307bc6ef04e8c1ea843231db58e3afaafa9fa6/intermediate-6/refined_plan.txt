1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(LockedRegionsMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
     – This map will track whether a lock (e.g. hsotg->lock) is currently held.  
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)  
     – This map is used to track pointer aliases (if necessary) so that if one pointer is modified or checked for protection, its aliases are updated too.

2. Choose Callback Functions and Detail Their Implementations:

   • In checkPreCall for Lock and Unlock:
     - Intercept calls to the locking APIs (spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore).
     - For spin_lock_irqsave:
         ▪ Identify the pointer expression in the call argument that represents the lock (e.g. hsotg->lock).
         ▪ Retrieve its associated MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr).
         ▪ Update state in LockedRegionsMap marking that region as “true” (i.e. lock is held).
     - For spin_unlock_irqrestore:
         ▪ Identify the lock pointer similarly.
         ▪ Update state in LockedRegionsMap marking that region as “false” (i.e. lock is not held).

   • In checkBind for Pointer Modifications:
     - Intercept the binding of a value to a field.
     - Specifically, check for assignments to the field named "hcpriv" of the urb structure.
         ▪ Use ExprHasName() on the LHS of the bind to see if the text contains "hcpriv".
     - If the assignment sets urb->hcpriv to NULL (or clears it), then retrieve the current program state.
     - From the state, determine the lock status by locating the associated lock region (e.g., retrieve hsotg->lock’s MemRegion).
         ▪ You may need to use any upward traversal helper (findSpecificTypeInParents) to find the hsotg->lock expression if not already available.
     - Check LockedRegionsMap for that region. If the lock is not held (i.e. false), issue a bug report.
         ▪ The report message should be short and clear (e.g. “Shared pointer modified outside lock”).
         ▪ Create a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

3. Implementation Order:
   - First, initialize and register your program state maps.
   - Hook into checkPreCall to update lock status (both on acquisition and release).
   - Hook into checkBind so that every time an assignment to "hcpriv" is performed, you check the current lock holding status.
   - Use any simple pointer analysis with PtrAliasMap to propagate the information if urb is alias‐assigned to other pointers.

This plan is designed to detect modifications of urb->hcpriv that occur without holding the associated hsotg->lock. By tracking the lock status and pointer assignments, your checker can issue a precise warning when a shared pointer is modified outside its lock protection, matching the target bug pattern.
