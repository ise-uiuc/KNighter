1. Customize the program state:
   • REGISTER a simple mapping using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to track the safety of pointer assignments for “urb->hcpriv”. For example, declare a map named PtrAssignState with key type const MemRegion* and value type bool. A value of false means the pointer was cleared (set to NULL) unsafely (i.e. outside a critical section), and true means it was assigned within a proper lock region.

2. Track pointer assignments in checkBind:
   • In the checkBind callback, examine bindings where a value is stored into a member that represents “urb->hcpriv”. Use the utility function ExprHasName to detect if the left-hand side expression contains “hcpriv”.
   • Check if the stored value is a NULL constant (by inspecting SVal or the corresponding symbolic value).
   • Use findSpecificTypeInParents to search upward in the AST and determine whether the assignment is performed under a lock (e.g. check that a spin_lock call is present in the parent's AST). If the assignment is not nested inside a block protected by the spinlock (you may look for a call to spin_lock_irqsave, for example), mark the corresponding MemRegion as unsafe (false) in the PtrAssignState map.
   • Otherwise, record that the pointer update is safe (true).

3. Check pointer usage in a call to dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue:
   • In the checkPreCall callback, intercept calls whose callee name is “dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue” (use the callee identifier from CallEvent).
   • Identify the parameter corresponding to “urb->hcpriv” from the arguments of the call. Retrieve the base memory region for this pointer with the getMemRegionFromExpr utility.
   • Look up the pointer’s region in the PtrAssignState map. If an entry exists and its flag indicates unsafe (false), then report a bug: use a concise message (for example, “Data race: unsynchronized clearing of urb->hcpriv”) along with generating a non-fatal error node.

4. Bug reporting:
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with your short message to emit the bug report when an unsafely cleared pointer is used.

By following these concrete steps—customizing a program state map, using checkBind to track assignments while evaluating if they occur under a spinlock, and finally using checkPreCall to inspect the pointer when it is used—you can detect the data race in which “urb->hcpriv” is reset outside the critical section.
