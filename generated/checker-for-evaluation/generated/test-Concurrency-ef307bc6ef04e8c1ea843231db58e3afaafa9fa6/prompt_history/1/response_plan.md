Your plan here

1. Decide to customize program state:
   • REGISTER a simple flag (e.g. using REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE or a small Boolean map) to record whether the protective lock has been released. This “LockReleased” flag will be set when a spin_unlock_irqrestore call is encountered and will be checked later during pointer assignments.
   • (Optionally) REGISTER a PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) to track aliasing if you need to follow urb->hcpriv’s propagation. In this case the checker is simple so alias tracking is secondary.

2. Use callback functions:
   a. In checkPreCall:
      • Hook into calls. When a call event is intercepted, use functionKnownToDeref or ExprHasName to determine if the call is to “spin_unlock_irqrestore”.
      • If so, update the program state so that the LockReleased flag is set to true. (This flag indicates that the lock protecting urb->hcpriv has already been released.)
      
   b. In checkBind:
      • Every time a binding occurs (e.g. an assignment), examine if the left-hand side is “urb->hcpriv”. Use ExprHasName to check if the expression’s source text contains “hcpriv”.
      • If that is true, evaluate the bound value to see if it is a null pointer.
      • If you detect an assignment of NULL to urb->hcpriv:
            – Retrieve the current program state and check the value of your LockReleased flag.
            – If the flag is true, then the assignment was performed after the lock was released. This is the atomicity violation you want to flag.
      • In such case, generate a bug report using a short, clear message (for example, “Atomicity violation: urb->hcpriv set to NULL after lock release”).
      • (Also update the PtrAliasMap if you are tracking aliases, so that if the same pointer is used further, its alias will be marked similarly.)

3. Finish configuration:
   • No other callbacks (e.g. BranchCondition) are needed since the core of the bug is detected from the ordering of the unlock call and the subsequent assignment.
   • Keep your implementation simple: intercept the spin_unlock call to mark the state, then in any checkBind for a “urb->hcpriv = NULL” assignment, if the lock is already released, report the error.

With this plan you cover detecting the concurrency bug pattern where modifying urb->hcpriv (setting it to NULL) is done outside of the lock protection, which might result in a NULL pointer use in a concurrent function call.
