1. Customize Program States:
   • Register a program state trait to track whether the lock is currently held. For simplicity, create a boolean flag (e.g., REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(LockIsHeld, bool)). This flag will be set to true when “spin_lock_irqsave” is called and reset to false when “spin_unlock_irqrestore” is called.
   • (Optional) If needed, you may also register a pointer alias map (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) but it is not mandatory for this simple atomicity check.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • checkPreCall (or checkPostCall) for Locking API:
     – In the checkPreCall callback, intercept calls to “spin_lock_irqsave”. Inspect the callee name (using getNameAsString or similar) and if it matches “spin_lock_irqsave”, update the program state so that LockIsHeld becomes true.
     – Similarly, in checkPreCall (or checkPostCall) intercept calls to “spin_unlock_irqrestore”. If the function name matches “spin_unlock_irqrestore”, update the program state so that LockIsHeld becomes false.
   • checkBind for Pointer Assignment:
     – In the checkBind callback, look for assignments where the left-hand side (LHS) is a member access involving “hcpriv” (use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the LHS contains “hcpriv”).
     – Evaluate the right-hand side (RHS) to determine if it is a NULL constant.
     – Retrieve the current value of LockIsHeld from the program state. If “hcpriv” is being set to NULL while LockIsHeld is false (i.e., outside the protection of the lock), then this indicates a potential atomicity violation.
     – Report a bug using a bug-report creation call (e.g., std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) with a short and clear message such as “Atomicity violation: urb->hcpriv modified outside lock”.
     
3. Implementation Details:
   • In checkPreCall for lock acquisition and release, use the utility functions to retrieve the callee’s name. Compare it with “spin_lock_irqsave” or “spin_unlock_irqrestore” and update the LockIsHeld flag in the program state accordingly.
   • In checkBind, use utility functions (like ExprHasName) to inspect the LHS expression. Evaluate the RHS (possibly using an expression evaluator) to check for NULL. Then use the current LockIsHeld flag to determine if the assignment occurs outside lock protection.
   • Generate the bug report immediately when a violation (i.e., assignment to NULL outside the lock) is detected.
   
This simple three-step plan (track lock state via program state, intercept locking API calls, and check pointer assignments in checkBind) will allow you to detect cases where urb->hcpriv is cleared (set to NULL) after releasing the lock, hence detecting the atomicity violation as described in the bug pattern.
