## Bug Pattern

Modifying a shared resource (in this case, the urb->hcpriv pointer) outside of its associated lockâ€™s protection. This pattern creates an atomicity violation where one thread may see a stale or partially updated value (or even a NULL) when it expects the pointer to be valid, leading to a race condition and potential NULL pointer dereference.
