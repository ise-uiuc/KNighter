Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Register Customized Program States

• Use a pointer-alias map to track relationships between pointers. For example, register a map called PtrAliasMap that binds a memregion pointer to its “checked” or “expected” memregion.  
  (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*))

• (Optionally) Register a program state map (say LockHeldMap) to record whether a statement is executed while a lock is held. Although you may not track all locks precisely, you can mark basic lock acquisitions via the AST.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. Use checkBind  
 • In checkBind, watch for assignments to the shared pointer “urb->hcpriv”.  
 • Filter bindings whose left-hand side is a member access with the name “hcpriv”. (You may use utility function ExprHasName or check the DeclRefExpr for the field.)  
 • When the binding is to a NULL value, it is a candidate for the bug pattern.  
 • Then, using the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents, traverse upward in the AST to check if this assignment is nested within a call to the locking primitives (for example, spin_lock_irqsave). If you do not find any enclosing lock acquisition, then the assignment is likely outside the critical section.  
 • If the assignment is determined “outside lock”, immediately report a bug using a concise message such as “Atomicity Violation: shared pointer modified outside lock.”

B. Use checkPreCall (Optional)  
 • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to functions that use “urb->hcpriv” (for example, the call to dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue).  
 • Retrieve the pointer argument and, using PtrAliasMap and getMemRegionFromExpr, determine if it had been recently bound to NULL in a suspect location.  
 • If so, generate a warning report for potential race/atomicity bug.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Detailed Steps for Each Callback

Step 3.1: In checkBind  
 – When a binding is done, inspect both the LHS and RHS of the assignment.  
 – If the LHS is “urb->hcpriv” (you may check that the expression text contains “hcpriv”) and the RHS is a NULL constant, then:  
  • Call findSpecificTypeInParents to search upward in the AST for a call to spin_lock_irqsave.  
  • If no such call is found in the parent chain (or if you find that a spin_unlock_irqrestore precedes the binding in the same compound statement), mark the binding as a potential violation.  
  • Emit a bug report via generateNonFatalErrorNode (or using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with the message “Atomicity Violation: shared pointer modified outside lock.”

Step 3.2: In checkPreCall (Optional enhancement)  
 – Check calls to functions that operate on “urb->hcpriv” (e.g., dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue).  
 – Using getMemRegionFromExpr, extract the region corresponding to the pointer argument.  
 – Consult your PtrAliasMap to trace if this pointer was previously changed by an assignment that was reported (or suspect) in checkBind.  
 – If so, issue a bug report indicating that the pointer might be used after being set to NULL outside the lock, leading to inconsistent state.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Reporting Bugs

• Always use concise bug messages (e.g., “Atomicity Violation: shared pointer modified outside lock”).  
• Use either PathSensitiveBugReport or BasicBugReport to emit nonfatal error nodes.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Summary

• Register a pointer alias map to track “urb->hcpriv” and copies.  
• In checkBind, hook all binding operations that assign NULL to “urb->hcpriv”.  
• Using AST upward traversal (findSpecificTypeInParents), verify that such assignment occurs under a lock.  
• In the absence of a lock-based context, report a bug.  
• Optionally, use checkPreCall to check if a later call using “urb->hcpriv” may use a pointer that was modified outside a reliable lock scope.

This plan is simple, uses few callbacks (primarily checkBind, with an optional checkPreCall), and uses the provided utility functions where possible to facilitate alias and AST analysis.
