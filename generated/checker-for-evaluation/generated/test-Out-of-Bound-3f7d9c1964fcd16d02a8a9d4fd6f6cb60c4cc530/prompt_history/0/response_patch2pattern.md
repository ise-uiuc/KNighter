## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the use of a length value read from device configuration (in this case, the hash key length) without validating that it is within safe bounds. If the value exceeds the maximum allowed size, subsequent memory operations (e.g., setting or reading the hash key) may access out-of-bound memory, leading to undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities.
