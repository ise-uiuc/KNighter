Your plan here

1. Decide to customize program state:
   • REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(HashKeyChecked, bool)
     – Initialize this trait as false at function entry.
     – This flag will record whether a validation check on the hash key length (i.e. comparing vi->rss_key_size with VIRTIO_NET_RSS_MAX_KEY_SIZE) has been encountered.

2. Choose callback functions:

   A. In checkBranchCondition:
      • Implement the callback to intercept “if” conditions.
      • Look for a binary operator (likely “>”) in which one operand’s source text contains "rss_key_size" and the other contains "VIRTIO_NET_RSS_MAX_KEY_SIZE".
      • Use utility function ExprHasName to check the text of both operands.
      • If the condition is detected, update the program state to mark HashKeyChecked as true.
      • This ensures that when the driver performs the boundary check on the hash key length, it is recorded.

   B. In checkPostCall:
      • Implement the callback to intercept function calls.
      • Identify the call to rss_indirection_table_alloc (using the call’s callee identifier, string comparison, etc.).
      • Retrieve the current program state flag HashKeyChecked.
      • If the flag is still false (i.e. no check of the hash key length was encountered), generate a bug report.
      • Use a short, clear message (e.g., “Unvalidated hash key length may lead to out-of-bound access.”) and emit the report with a non‐fatal error node.

3. Summary of implementation steps:
   • Register the HashKeyChecked state variable; set as false initially.
   • In checkBranchCondition, examine every branch condition and, when a condition similar to “if (vi->rss_key_size > VIRTIO_NET_RSS_MAX_KEY_SIZE)” is found, update the state to true.
   • In checkPostCall, upon encountering a critical memory operation (rss_indirection_table_alloc) that uses the hash key length value, inspect the state. If no validation branch was found (HashKeyChecked still false), report a potential error.
   
This plan is simple and leverages a single customized program state flag along with standard callbacks (BranchCondition for the check and PostCall for detecting usage) so that the checker properly flags the bug pattern when the hash key length is not validated.
