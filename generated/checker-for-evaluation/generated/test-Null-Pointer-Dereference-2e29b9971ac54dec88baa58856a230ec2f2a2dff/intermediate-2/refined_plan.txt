Your plan here

1. Customize Program States
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocatedPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will record the memory region returned by kzalloc. For every call to kzalloc, mark its returned region in AllocatedPtrMap.
   • (Optional) REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
     – This map is used to track pointer aliasing if you wish to update the check when an alias of the allocated pointer is used.

2. Choose Callbacks and Their Implementation

   A. checkPostCall
      • In the checkPostCall callback, intercept the call event.
      • Identify if the call is to kzalloc. (You can check if the callee’s name is "kzalloc".)
      • Using the CallEvent, extract the return value’s memory region with getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Update the AllocatedPtrMap by marking this region as “expected” to be null-checked.
      • (Optional) Also record the “expected” field name (e.g. "sve_state") by extracting it from the source code via utility functions such as ExprHasName or by checking the DeclRefExpr in the assignment. Store it (or its region) so you have a reference for later comparison.

   B. checkBranchCondition
      • In the checkBranchCondition callback, hook into every if-condition.
      • Analyze the condition expression to detect a null check. Detect patterns such as a unary '!' or binary comparison against 0 or NULL.
      • Using getMemRegionFromExpr, extract the memory region from the pointer being tested.
      • Also, use ExprHasName (with a target string like "za_state" vs. "sve_state") to get the source text from the condition.
      • Compare the memory region (or the field name) in the condition against the region (or expected field name) stored in AllocatedPtrMap.
         – If the branch is checking a pointer that is not the allocated "sve_state" (for instance, if it is checking "za_state" while kzalloc was performed for "sve_state"), then the bug pattern is present.
      • When the mismatch is detected, report the bug with a short, clear message (e.g. "Incorrect pointer check for allocation failure"). Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to generate the report.

   C. checkBind (Optional, for Pointer Aliasing)
      • In checkBind, intercept assignments of pointer values. When a pointer with a memory region from kzalloc is assigned to another pointer, update the PtrAliasMap.
      • When processing a branch condition, also consult PtrAliasMap so that if an alias is being null checked, it is correctly recognized.
      • This step is optional if your checker can assume a direct use of the allocated pointer in the null check.

3. Summary of the Checker Flow
   • During analysis, when a kzalloc call is detected (in checkPostCall):
       – Mark the returned memory region into AllocatedPtrMap.
       – Optionally record the expected field name ("sve_state").
   • Later, when an if-statement’s condition is encountered (in checkBranchCondition):
       – Extract the pointer (and its field name) being null-checked.
       – Compare it with the pointer region recorded for kzalloc.
       – If the condition is testing a different pointer (e.g. "za_state"), report a short bug message indicating that the wrong pointer is being checked for allocation failure.
   • (Optional) Update/propagate the state via checkBind if aliasing is involved.

This plan uses the simplest approach with two primary callbacks (checkPostCall and checkBranchCondition) to detect the error pattern of checking the wrong pointer after an allocation, while also recommending the use of available utility functions to manipulate and compare the AST nodes and program state.
