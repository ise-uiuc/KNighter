1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will track memory regions where a kzalloc result is assigned to the sve_state field.
     – The boolean flag is set to true when the allocation is “pending” a proper null-check.

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. checkBind
      – In this callback, examine every binding operation.
      – If the LHS of the assignment is a member access and its source text (using ExprHasName) contains "sve_state", then:
         • Check if the RHS is a call to kzalloc.
         • If so, use getMemRegionFromExpr on the RHS to retrieve the allocated memory’s region.
         • Record in AllocMap that this region has been allocated (mark it true).
      – This ensures that every kzalloc allocation into the sve_state field is tracked.

   B. checkBranchCondition
      – In this callback, inspect every if-condition.
      – Look for conditional expressions that perform a null-check. Use utility function ExprHasName to detect if the condition’s source text mentions "za_state" instead of "sve_state".
      – When a null-check is found:
         • Retrieve the memory region (using getMemRegionFromExpr) being checked.
         • Inspect the AllocMap to see if there is a record for a previously allocated sve_state region.
         • If the condition checks a field that does not correspond to the tracked allocation (i.e. “za_state” instead of “sve_state”), then a mismatched null-check is detected.
      – Upon detecting such a mismatch, report the bug by generating a non-fatal error node and emit a bug report with a short, clear message (for example: "Mismatched null-check: allocation from kzalloc not verified via sve_state").

3. Summary:
   – Use checkBind to capture correct kzalloc allocations by detecting assignments into the sve_state field and storing the associated memory region in AllocMap.
   – Use checkBranchCondition to intercept null-check conditions. Identify if the code erroneously checks a different field (e.g., za_state) rather than the allocated sve_state.
   – Issue a bug report when AllocMap indicates a pending kzalloc allocation for sve_state but the condition checks the wrong field.
   
This plan uses minimal steps while leveraging the available utility functions and callbacks for a straightforward implementation of a mismatched null-check checker.
