Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State

• REGISTER a simple map (e.g. KzallocCheckMap) that tracks the expected pointer field name for a given memory region. For instance, use
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(KzallocCheckMap, const MemRegion*, std::string)
This map will record that when a kzalloc call is “bound” into a field, the expected (correct) field name should be recorded (e.g. "sve_state").

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Track the Pointer Binding via checkBind

• In the checkBind callback, detect assignments where the return of a kzalloc call is stored.
  – Check if the RHS of the binding is a CallExpr to kzalloc. (You may check the callee name using the CallEvent or by inspecting the source text.)
  – Then inspect the LHS (the location being bound) and use getMemRegionFromExpr to get its region.
  – Further inspect the LHS’s source text (using utility ExprHasName) to determine whether it is “sve_state”. If it is, record in the KzallocCheckMap that this region is associated with the expected field “sve_state”.
This way you can later compare if the pointer’s null-check is done on the correct member.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Check the Condition in checkBranchCondition

• In checkBranchCondition, look for if-statements that serve as a NULL check.
  – When an if-condition is encountered, use getMemRegionFromExpr on the condition’s expression so as to obtain the pointer’s memory region.
  – If the region exists in KzallocCheckMap, that means a kzalloc allocation has been bound earlier.
  – Next, use the utility function ExprHasName (or similar string extraction over the source text) to check if the condition is actually testing the expected pointer name (i.e. "sve_state"). For the bug pattern the actual test might be on a different field (e.g. “za_state”). 
  – If the condition does not contain the expected field name, then that signals the bug pattern: an incorrect NULL check after kzalloc. 
  – Generate a concise bug report (e.g., “Wrong NULL check after kzalloc”) using a bug reporting helper (like generateNonFatalErrorNode with an appropriate message).

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Bug Reporting

• When a mismatch is detected (i.e. the condition is not using the expected field name for the pointer allocated via kzalloc), report the bug.
  – Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create your report.
  – Ensure the message is short and clear, e.g. “Incorrect NULL check: expected check on 'sve_state'”.
  – Report the bug through CheckerContext’s emit mechanism.

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Callbacks and Steps

• Customize Program State:
  – REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(KzallocCheckMap, const MemRegion*, std::string)

• checkBind:
  – Look for pointer bindings where the RHS is a kzalloc call.
  – Ensure the LHS is a member of dst (by checking the source text) and, if it is “sve_state”, store its MemRegion into KzallocCheckMap with expected name “sve_state”.

• checkBranchCondition:
  – When an if-statement is encountered, extract the pointer’s region being checked.
  – If the region exists in KzallocCheckMap, compare the field name in the condition’s source text.
  – If the checked pointer name does not match the expected “sve_state”, fire the bug report.

This simple plan uses fewer steps and reuses utility functions to inspect source text and memory regions, allowing you to pinpoint the copy‐paste error where the wrong field is checked.
