1. Customize Program State

 • REGISTER a map called AllocatedFieldMap using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE that maps a MemRegion (from a pointer value) to a string representing the field name that was intended to be checked (e.g. "sve_state").

2. Track Pointer Assignment in checkBind

 • In the checkBind callback, look for assignments where a pointer is bound to a destination expression.
 • Inspect the LHS of the assignment to see if it is a member expression whose source text contains the target field name "sve_state" (using ExprHasName).
 • Verify that the RHS is a call to kzalloc() (using the callee’s name or comparing the call’s source text).
 • If both are satisfied, retrieve the MemRegion corresponding to the LHS and record it in AllocatedFieldMap with the string "sve_state". This models that a memory region allocated via kzalloc is meant to be stored in sve_state.

3. Hook the Incorrect Null Check in checkBranchCondition

 • In the checkBranchCondition callback, intercept the condition of an if statement.
 • Use ExprHasName to check if the condition’s source text contains "za_state". This indicates that the null check is performed on the wrong field.
 • Optionally, further examine if the condition is a null check by verifying that it compares the pointer to NULL (e.g. a unary ‘!’ operator or a binary comparison with NULL).
 • If such a check is detected, verify against the AllocatedFieldMap: if the checker previously recorded an allocation for "sve_state" (from kzalloc) and now the code tests "za_state", this is a bug.
 • Emit a bug report with a short and clear message, e.g., “Incorrect null pointer check after kzalloc”.

4. Bug Reporting

 • In checkBranchCondition when the suspicious condition is found, create a non-fatal error node.
 • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) to report the bug with the concise message.
 • Optionally, add the source location from the condition to help the user identify the problematic check.

This plan uses the provided utility functions (like ExprHasName) and leverages checkBind to track pointer allocations as well as checkBranchCondition to catch the erroneous null check. Following these steps should allow you to detect when a memory allocation is made for "sve_state" but later the code uses a check on "za_state", which is the precise bug pattern in the patch.
