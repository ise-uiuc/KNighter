## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is an incorrect null pointer check after memory allocation. The code allocates memory for dst->thread.sve_state using kzalloc() but then mistakenly checks dst->thread.za_state to verify if the allocation was successful. This mismatch in pointers means that a failure in allocating sve_state may go unnoticed, potentially leading to dereferencing a null pointer.
