## Bug Pattern

In the error handling path following a reallocation failure, a previously allocated resource (in this case, the 'efuse' buffer) is not freed before returning an error, resulting in a memory leak. This pattern occurs when an allocation function (like devm_krealloc) fails and the cleanup of other allocated resources is not performed, leading to resource leakage.
