Your plan here

1. Decide if program state maps are needed  
 • In this case, you can simplify by not using a custom program state map. Since the checker’s goal is to verify that in an error branch following a devm_krealloc call a kfree is called to clean up an “efuse” allocation, you only need to inspect control flow in the region rather than tracking pointer aliasing.  
 • (Optional) You may use a simple program state map to flag when an “efuse” resource is active, but it is not strictly necessary.

2. Choose callback functions  
 a. Use checkPostCall to intercept function calls.  
  – In checkPostCall, identify calls to devm_krealloc(). Verify if the call’s callee name matches "devm_krealloc".  
  – Record that a candidate resource (efuse) may need cleanup if the reallocation fails. For simplicity, note that the following if-statement is expected to check for a null return.  
 b. Use checkBranchCondition to inspect the error checking branch  
  – In checkBranchCondition, look at the condition expression to see if it is a null check on the reallocation result (for example, a unary operator “!” applied to the pointer or a binary equality comparison with zero).  
  – When the condition matches a potential error branch for devm_krealloc failure, obtain its then-branch block.
 c. Use checkPostCall (or alternatively traverse the then-branch by using findSpecificTypeInChildren)  
  – In this then-branch, search for a call to kfree. Use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the call’s source text contains "kfree" and verify that the argument’s source text contains "efuse".  
 d. If no such kfree call is found within the error branch, report a bug using a simple bug report (e.g. generate a nonfatal error node and report a message like "Memory leak: 'efuse' not freed on devm_krealloc failure").

3. Implementation details per callback  
 • In checkPostCall for devm_krealloc:  
  – Retrieve the CallEvent’s callee identifier and check if it equals "devm_krealloc".  
  – (Optionally) Save the “efuse” variable or its associated MemRegion if retrievable, to later match against kfree call arguments.  
 • In checkBranchCondition:  
  – Examine the condition expression. If it is a null check (using a unary operator “!” or a BinaryOperator comparing the pointer to 0) on the result of devm_krealloc, then retrieve the then-block (using findSpecificTypeInChildren on the if-statement block).  
 • In the then-block analysis (inside checkPostCall or by walking the subtree in checkBranchCondition):  
  – Look for a call expression whose callee is "kfree".  
  – Use getSourceText or ExprHasName to inspect the argument: if it contains the identifier "efuse", then the resource is freed.  
  – If not, then generate and emit a bug report indicating that in the error handling path the efuse resource is leaked.
  
4. Bug reporting  
 • When the error branch does not include a call to kfree for efuse, use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) to create a report with a short message such as "Memory leak: 'efuse' not freed on reallocation failure".

By following these steps and using the provided utility functions to examine AST nodes and extract names from expressions, you can implement a concise checker that detects the missing cleanup for efuse in the error branch after devm_krealloc failure.
