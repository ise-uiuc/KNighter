1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a program state map:
     – Define a map named DeviceManagedMap associating MemRegion pointers with a bool flag. The flag should be set to true when memory is allocated using a devm_* function.
   • (Optional) For pointer alias tracking, register a PtrAliasMap using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to record aliases if required.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   A. Detection on Memory Allocations (checkPostCall):
      • Intercept calls to allocation functions.
      • In checkPostCall, check if the callee is a device-managed allocator such as devm_kcalloc.
      • Retrieve the return expression’s MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Mark this region as device-managed by setting its flag to true in DeviceManagedMap.
   B. Detection on Freeing (checkPreCall):
      • Intercept calls to a free function such as pinctrl_utils_free_map.
      • For the targeted free functions, extract the pointer parameter that is being freed.
      • Retrieve the corresponding MemRegion from the pointer.
      • Consult DeviceManagedMap to see if this region was marked as device-managed.
      • If found, generate a bug report with a short message (e.g., "Double free: Manual free on devm allocated memory").
   C. Pointer Alias Propagation (checkBind):
      • Use checkBind to update PtrAliasMap when one pointer is bound to another.
      • Ensure that if one of the aliases is marked device-managed, all its aliases become marked too.
      • This ensures that the checker reliably tracks the pointer regardless of aliasing changes.

3. Bug Reporting:
   • Use a non-fatal error node (e.g., generateNonFatalErrorNode) to report the issue.
   • Create a PathSensitiveBugReport or BasicBugReport with a concise error message: "Double free: Manual free on devm allocated memory."
   • The report should trigger during the pre-call check of the free function if a device-managed region is being manually freed.

This simple three-step plan (memory allocation tracking, free call checking, and alias propagation) will allow you to reliably detect the bug pattern where device-managed memory is manually freed without unnecessary complexity.
