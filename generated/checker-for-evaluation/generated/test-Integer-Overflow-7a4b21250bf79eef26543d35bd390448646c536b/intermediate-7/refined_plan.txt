Your plan is as follows:

1. Use the checkPostCall callback to intercept calls to roundup_pow_of_two():
   • In checkPostCall, examine the Callee name and, if it is "roundup_pow_of_two", retrieve the call’s argument.
   • Use the utility function ExprHasName() on the argument to check that it comes from “max_entries”; this confirms that we are processing the right call.

2. Locate a preceding safety check using findSpecificTypeInParents():
   • Starting from the roundup_pow_of_two() call’s AST node, use findSpecificTypeInParents<IfStmt>() to search for an enclosing if-statement.
   • From the if-statement, use ExprHasName() on its condition to search for the target string "1UL << 31".
   • This tells you whether the programmer validated that attr->max_entries is below the dangerous threshold before performing roundup_pow_of_two().

3. Issue a warning when an unsafe pattern is detected:
   • If no appropriate if-statement is found, or if the if-statement’s condition does not include the intended threshold check ("1UL << 31"), report a bug.
   • Use a bug reporting helper (for instance, by generating an error node with generateNonFatalErrorNode) and then create a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a brief, clear message like: "Unchecked max_entries: potential arithmetic overflow in roundup_pow_of_two."

4. No customized program state is needed:
   • Since the checker only inspects a branch condition and the call argument, there’s no requirement to track allocation state or aliases using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE.

Following these concrete steps, you will cover the bug pattern of performing potentially unsafe arithmetic on attr->max_entries without validating its range.
