## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is performing arithmetic operations that could overflow—and even invoke undefined behavior—without first validating the input to ensure it is within safe limits. In this case, using roundup_pow_of_two() on attr->max_entries on 32‑bit architectures may lead to an overflow during a left-shift operation, causing undefined behavior. The error is rooted in not checking that the value is limited (e.g., attr->max_entries is below a threshold) before performing the rounding operation that involves bit shifts.
