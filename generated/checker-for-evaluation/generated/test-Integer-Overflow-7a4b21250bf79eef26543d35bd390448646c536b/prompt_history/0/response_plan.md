Your plan here

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No need to customize any program state maps using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE. This checker only needs to verify that a safe bound check is present (or not) within the control flow around the call to roundup_pow_of_two.

2. Choose Callback Function – checkPostCall:
   • In the checkPostCall callback, intercept every call event.
   • When a call is made, check if the callee’s name equals "roundup_pow_of_two".
   
3. Filtering the Relevant Argument:
   • Once a call to roundup_pow_of_two is detected, retrieve its single argument expression.
   • Use the utility function ExprHasName to determine if the argument’s source text contains "max_entries" (this identifies the attribute field involved) so that you confirm it is the problematic case.

4. Searching for a Preceding Guard Condition:
   • Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents<IfStmt>(...) on the statement corresponding to the call to search upward for an if-statement.
   • For each encountered if-statement in the ancestor chain, obtain its condition and use ExprHasName to test whether the condition contains the safe threshold “1UL << 31” (or a similar string representation that indicates a proper check on max_entries).
   • If at least one such if-statement that tests the safe bound is found, consider the usage safe and do nothing further.

5. Reporting the Bug:
   • If no suitable guard condition is found in the ancestral if-statements, generate a bug report.
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) to report a short and clear message such as "Unsafe call to roundup_pow_of_two: missing check for max_entries > 1UL << 31".
   • Emit the bug report via the CheckerContext’s reporting mechanism.

By following these steps in checkPostCall you can keep the checker simple: intercept the dangerous call, examine the argument and its guarding conditions, and report a bug if the explicit safe bound check is missing.
