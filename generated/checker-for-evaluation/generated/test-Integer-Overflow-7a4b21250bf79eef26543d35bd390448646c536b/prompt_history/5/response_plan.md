1. Identify Relevant Function and Locate Target Call:
   • Use the checkASTCodeBody callback to visit every function definition.
   • Inside checkASTCodeBody, filter for the function named "stack_map_alloc" – this limits the analysis to our target function.
   • Traverse the function’s body to locate the call to roundup_pow_of_two(). Use the helper utility (e.g., ExprHasName) to detect that the call involves "roundup_pow_of_two". Also confirm that the argument originates from attr->max_entries (by matching the expression text or via DeclRefExpr inspection).

2. Check for Proper Input Validation:
   • Traverse the statement list in the function body (or use an AST visitor) to search for any if-statement that explicitly compares attr->max_entries with "1UL << 31".
   • Use checkBranchCondition to intercept branch conditions in if-stmts. For each branch condition, use utility functions (or getNameAsString on identifiers inside the condition) to check if the condition contains "max_entries" and "1UL << 31".
   • Record in a temporary flag (local to the function analysis) whether the proper check is present before the usage of roundup_pow_of_two.

3. Report the Bug if Input is Unchecked:
   • If a call to roundup_pow_of_two() is found and no earlier if-statement has validated that attr->max_entries is <= (1UL << 31), then the checker should flag a bug.
   • In that case, generate a bug report with a short, clear message like "Unchecked input to roundup_pow_of_two() may overflow on 32-bit arches".
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to report the issue.

4. (Optional) Use Program State if Necessary:
   • No customized program state maps (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE or REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) are strictly needed because this bug pattern only involves control-flow and expression analysis.
   • If you wish to track that the if-statement check “attr->max_entries > 1UL << 31” has been seen, you could register a boolean flag in the program state. However, the simplest approach is to perform a local check within checkASTCodeBody by walking the AST in order.

Summary of Callback Implementation:
   • In checkASTCodeBody:
       – Identify "stack_map_alloc" and traverse its body.
       – Locate and record if an if-statement exists that verifies attr->max_entries against (1UL << 31). (For each BranchCondition, use ExprHasName to search for "max_entries" and compare the text for "1UL << 31".)
       – Locate the call to roundup_pow_of_two() (using ExprHasName).
       – If the call exists without a prior proper check, emit a bug report.
   • Do not add complexity with pointer aliasing or taint tracking as they are not required for this check.

This plan is simple and direct: by using checkASTCodeBody, you perform a sequential inspection of the function “stack_map_alloc”, verify that safe input is checked before the call, and then report a bug if the input has not been validated.
