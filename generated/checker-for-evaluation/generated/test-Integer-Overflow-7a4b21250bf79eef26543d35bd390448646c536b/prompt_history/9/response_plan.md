Your plan here

1. No custom program state is needed for this checker.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept calls to the function roundup_pow_of_two. In checkPreCall:
   • Check if the callee’s name is "roundup_pow_of_two" using Call.getCalleeIdentifier().
   • Extract the first argument (expected to be attr->max_entries) from the call event.
   
3. Look upward in the AST from the call using findSpecificTypeInParents to search for a surrounding if-statement.
   • For each encountered IfStmt, extract its condition’s source text (using Lexer::getSourceText as in utility function ExprHasName).
   • Examine the condition text to determine if it includes a check against the overflow risk, for example by containing the substring "1UL << 31" (or similar) that verifies attr->max_entries is not too large.
   
4. If no if-statement with the appropriate check is found before the call to roundup_pow_of_two, then report the bug.
   • Create a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short, clear message such as "Unchecked use of roundup_pow_of_two: potential overflow on 32-bit arches".
   • Emit the bug report.
   
5. In summary, the checker uses checkPreCall to intercept roundup_pow_of_two calls, then uses upward AST traversal (via findSpecificTypeInParents) combined with source text analysis (via ExprHasName and Lexer) to decide whether an appropriate guard against overflow exists. If not, the checker reports a warning.
