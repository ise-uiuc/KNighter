## Bug Pattern

Performing arithmetic operations (specifically left shifts used in rounding up to the nearest power of two) on unchecked integer inputs can cause an overflow, leading to undefined behavior on 32-bit systems. In this case, calling roundup_pow_of_two() without first ensuring that the value being rounded is within a safe range allows a potential overflow in the intermediate 32-bit arithmetic, making it necessary to check the value before applying the operation.
