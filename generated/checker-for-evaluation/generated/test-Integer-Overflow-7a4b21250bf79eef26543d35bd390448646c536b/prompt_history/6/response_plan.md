Your plan here

1. Check if a custom program state is needed:  
 • In this checker no pointer‐alias or region tainting is necessary, so no custom REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE is required.

2. Use the checkASTCodeBody callback to analyze the body of each function:  
 • In checkASTCodeBody, look for the function named "stack_map_alloc" (using getNameAsString()).  
 • Traverse its AST to locate the use of the rounding function: find a call expression with the callee "roundup_pow_of_two".  
 • Also traverse the AST to collect any if statements in the function body.  
 • For each if statement, use the utility function ExprHasName to check if its condition text contains both "max_entries" and the constant "1UL << 31". If such an if statement exists, mark that the overflow pre-check has been performed.

3. Compare the results:  
 • If a call to roundup_pow_of_two is found and no corresponding overflow check (if statement) is present before it, then the bug pattern is matched.

4. Report a bug:  
 • Create a short bug report (for example, using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a message such as "Missing pre-check for potential overflow in roundup_pow_of_two".  
 • Then, emit the report for the matched AST path.

This step‐by‐step plan is simple, follows minimal steps, and is concrete enough for you to implement the checker.
