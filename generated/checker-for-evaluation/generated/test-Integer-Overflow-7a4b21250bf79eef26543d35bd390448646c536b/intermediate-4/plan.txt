Your plan here

1. Determine Program State Requirements:
   • No customized program state is needed since this bug pattern does not involve tracking pointer aliases or taint propagation. All the detection revolves around the ordering/absence of an explicit check versus a dangerous call.

2. Callback Selection – Use checkASTCodeBody:
   • Register a callback for checkASTCodeBody so that you can analyze the complete body of functions.
   • In the callback, check if the FunctionDecl’s name is "stack_map_alloc". If not, simply return.

3. Locate the Dangerous Call:
   • Traverse the AST of the function body to locate the call expression invoking roundup_pow_of_two.
   • Use an AST matcher or a RecursiveASTVisitor to find call expressions where the callee’s name is "roundup_pow_of_two".
   • Also, inspect the argument passed (likely attr->max_entries) to gain context.

4. Detect Missing Guard Check:
   • Once you find a call to roundup_pow_of_two, look for an explicit guard condition that checks the size before the call.
   • Search the surrounding code (or scan the function body) for an if statement (or any branch condition) that checks whether attr->max_entries is greater than "1UL << 31" (or contains an equivalent numeric comparison).
   • You can use the utility function ExprHasName to inspect if a condition’s source text contains "attr->max_entries" and "<<" (or the specific constant value) to decide if it is applying the needed check.
   • If no such conditional guard is found before the call to roundup_pow_of_two, note that this is a bug.

5. Bug Reporting:
   • When a dangerous use of roundup_pow_of_two is detected without the proper overflow check, generate a bug report.
   • Use a simple bug report message such as "Unchecked integer overflow risk in roundup_pow_of_two call".
   • Create the bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> and emit it using the provided reporting APIs.

6. Implementation Specifics:
   • In checkASTCodeBody, after confirming you are in stack_map_alloc, iterate over the AST.
   • For each call to roundup_pow_of_two, check if the function body also has an if statement that tests attr->max_entries against 1UL << 31.
   • If not, invoke the bug reporter to flag the potential integer overflow.

By following these steps, you’ll have a concise checker that flags code vulnerable to undefined behavior caused by unchecked integer overflows in the call to roundup_pow_of_two on 32‑bit architectures.
