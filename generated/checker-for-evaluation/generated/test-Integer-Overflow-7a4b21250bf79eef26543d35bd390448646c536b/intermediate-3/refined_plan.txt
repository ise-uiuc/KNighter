Your plan is as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide if custom program states are needed  
   • In this case, no custom program state map is strictly necessary.  
   • We can solve the problem by analyzing the AST of the call and its surroundings (i.e. the if‐statement conditions).  

2. Choose the callback functions  
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept each call event.  
   • Use the provided utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to look upward in the AST to detect if an appropriate if-statement is present.  

3. Implementation steps in checkPreCall  
   a. In checkPreCall, inspect the callee’s identifier.  
      – When the callee’s name is “roundup_pow_of_two”, we know we are handling a potential problematic call.  
   b. Retrieve the first argument passed into roundup_pow_of_two.  
      – Use the utility function ExprHasName to check that the expression contains “max_entries”. This ensures that we are targeting the intended use (e.g. “attr->max_entries”).  
   c. Use findSpecificTypeInParents to traverse upward from the call site looking for an if-statement.  
      – For each found if-statement, get its condition and, via getSourceText or getNameAsString, check if it contains the safe-range check (e.g. “1UL << 31” or an equivalent comparison against attr->max_entries).  
      – If you detect an if-statement whose condition text contains “1UL << 31” (or equivalent) along with “max_entries”, then consider the check as present.  
   d. If no such safe check is found in the parents, then generate a bug report.  
      – Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short message such as:  
        "Unchecked input to roundup_pow_of_two: possible overflow on 32-bit arches".  
      – Emit the report using the CheckerContext’s reporting mechanism.  

4. Summary and Additional Notes  
   • The checker only needs to inspect call events for roundup_pow_of_two.  
   • By examining the parent if-statements with findSpecificTypeInParents and using ExprHasName to parse the branch condition text, you can detect whether there is a pre-call range check.  
   • Keep the steps as simple and direct as possible: catch the call, validate its argument, scan for the appropriate branch and if none is found, report the potential bug.  
   • No pointer aliasing analysis or program state binding is needed, so you avoid extra complexity.  

-----------------------------------------------------------
Following this plan will produce a checker that accurately warns when the input to roundup_pow_of_two is not properly constrained before its use, potentially causing an overflow on 32-bit architectures.
