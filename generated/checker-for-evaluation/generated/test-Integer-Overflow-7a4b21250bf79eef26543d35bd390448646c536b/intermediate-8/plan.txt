1. Customize Program State Maps:
   • Create a program state map using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(SafeMaxEntriesMap, const MemRegion*, bool) to record whether a “max_entries” value has been pre-checked against the safe threshold (1UL << 31).

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. checkBranchCondition Callback:
      • In checkBranchCondition, examine each branch condition’s AST expression.
      • Use the utility function ExprHasName to detect if the condition text contains the substring "max_entries". Also check (by string search) if it contains "1UL << 31" (or an equivalent representation) so that you know the condition is specifically guarding against too-large values.
      • When such a condition is found, identify the expression representing the "max_entries" value (for example, by traversing the children of the condition using findSpecificTypeInChildren).
      • Retrieve the corresponding memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Update the program state’s SafeMaxEntriesMap for that region by setting its flag to true; this indicates that the value has been checked for safety before further use.

   B. checkPreCall Callback:
      • In checkPreCall, intercept calls by examining the callee’s identifier. If the function called is "roundup_pow_of_two", proceed with the check.
      • Retrieve the single argument passed to roundup_pow_of_two from the call event.
      • Use getMemRegionFromExpr to extract the memory region corresponding to that argument.
      • Query the SafeMaxEntriesMap in the current program state to see if this region has been marked as having undergone a safe check.
      • If the region is not flagged (or if no check was performed), then report a bug using a concise warning message (for example, “Unchecked rounding up may overflow on 32-bit arches”) by generating a bug report through std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>.

3. Summary of Implementation Steps:
   • At analyzer startup (during function analysis), register the SafeMaxEntriesMap program state.
   • For every branch condition in checkBranchCondition, inspect whether it is guarding the "max_entries" field by matching for the pattern "max_entries > 1UL << 31". If it is, mark the corresponding memory region as safe.
   • For every call to roundup_pow_of_two in checkPreCall, extract its argument’s mem region and use the program state map to determine if a safe check has occurred. If not, emit the bug report.

Following this plan provides a concise way to hook both branch conditions and the call site, use a custom program state to track safe-guarded values, and report an error when the unchecked arithmetic (roundup_pow_of_two without prior safe check) is detected.
