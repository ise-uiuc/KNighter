Plan:
1. In the checkPostCall callback, intercept calls to the function:
   • Examine each CallEvent and check if the callee’s name is "roundup_pow_of_two".
   • If so, retrieve the argument (which should be attr->max_entries) passed to it.
2. Evaluate the argument to determine its potential value:
   • First attempt to use EvaluateExprToInt on the argument expression.
   • If the value is not statically evaluable, then, if applicable, use inferSymbolMaxVal on the symbol obtained from the argument to get its maximum value.
3. Compare the obtained value (or maximum allowed value) against the safe threshold (1UL << 31):
   • If the evaluated (or inferred maximum) value is greater than the threshold, it indicates that the value is not pre-checked for overflow before being used in a left shift (inside roundup_pow_of_two).
4. Report the bug:
   • Create a short, clear bug report (using, for example, std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) stating that unchecked arithmetic on attr->max_entries may lead to an overflow in roundup_pow_of_two.
5. No custom program state maps are needed for this checker because the check is localized to the call instance rather than involving pointer or alias tracking.

This plan uses the checkPostCall callback to examine calls to roundup_pow_of_two, leverages EvaluateExprToInt/inferSymbolMaxVal to assess the argument, and directly compares it to the safe threshold.
