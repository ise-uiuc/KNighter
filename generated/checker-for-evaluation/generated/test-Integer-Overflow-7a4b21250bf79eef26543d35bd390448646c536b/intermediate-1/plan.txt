1. No need to declare new program state maps.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept calls to roundup_pow_of_two. In the checkPreCall function:
   • Identify call events whose callee identifier is "roundup_pow_of_two".
   • Retrieve the single argument (the value fed to the rounding function). Use EvaluateExprToInt if the argument is a constant expression.
   • If the argument evaluates to an integer and is safely below the threshold (e.g., ≤ (1UL << 31)), then do nothing. If it evaluates to a constant that clearly violates the safe range, report a bug.
   • If the argument is not a constant, then look upward in the AST (using findSpecificTypeInParents<IfStmt>) to check if there is a guarding branch condition that compares the argument with (1UL << 31).
     – Use the helper ExprHasName to quickly check if the guard condition’s source text contains both the variable name (such as "max_entries") and the literal "1UL<<31" (or its textual equivalent).
     – If such a condition exists, assume the check is in place and do not report an error.
     – Otherwise, generate a bug report with a short, clear message (e.g., "Unchecked use of roundup_pow_of_two: potential UB on 32-bit arches").

3. For bug reporting, use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with the location of the call and the short message indicating that the input to roundup_pow_of_two has not been validated against a safe range.

4. In summary, the checker workflow is:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept any call to roundup_pow_of_two.
   • Evaluate the argument. If constant and unsafe, report immediately.
   • If nonconstant, search parent AST nodes for a guarding branch condition. If none is found, report the potential faulty use.
   
This simple approach uses only the checkPreCall callback along with upward AST examination (via findSpecificTypeInParents) and source text pattern matching (via ExprHasName) to detect the missing pre-validation guard.
