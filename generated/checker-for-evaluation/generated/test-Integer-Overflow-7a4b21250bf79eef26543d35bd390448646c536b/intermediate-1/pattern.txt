## Bug Pattern

Using a power-of-two rounding function (roundup_pow_of_two()) without first validating that the input value is within a safe range can lead to an integer overflow via a left-shift operation on 32-bit systems. This pattern manifests when the unchecked input exceeds a limit (here, when max_entries > 1UL<<31), causing undefined behavior due to the overflow in the shifting operation.
