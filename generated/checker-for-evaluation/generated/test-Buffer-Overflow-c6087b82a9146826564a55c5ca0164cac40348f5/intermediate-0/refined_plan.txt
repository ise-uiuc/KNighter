Your plan is as follows:

1. Identify if custom program state maps are needed:
   • In this checker you do not need to track pointer aliasing or taint information using program state maps. Instead, the key is to compare the fixed destination size with the third argument of the copy_from_user call. Therefore, you do not need to REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE custom maps.

2. Choose the callback function:
   • Use checkPreCall since you need to intercept calls to copy_from_user before the call is executed.
   
3. Implementation details inside checkPreCall:
   a. In the checkPreCall callback, check if the callee name is "copy_from_user". You can compare the IdentifierInfo from Call.getCalleeIdentifier() to the string "copy_from_user".
   b. If a copy_from_user call is detected, extract the three arguments:
      – The first argument is the destination buffer. Use the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr to extract the fixed size of the destination. (The destination must be a DeclRefExpr that refers to a fixed-size array.)
      – The third argument is the number of bytes (nbytes) provided by the user. Use the EvaluateExprToInt utility to see if it can be determined as a concrete value.
   c. If both the fixed array size and the nbytes value are available:
      – Compare the nbytes value with the extracted array size (or array size minus 1 if you want to model the null terminator scenario). If nbytes exceeds the fixed size, then it is a potential buffer overflow.
      – Report this bug by generating a non-fatal error node and creating a bug report (e.g., using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) with a concise message such as "Potential buffer overflow: copy_from_user argument exceeds fixed buffer size."
   d. In the case the nbytes value is symbolic or not directly evaluable to a constant, you may still report a warning if you can deduce that it exceeds or might exceed the fixed array capacity. (For example, if program state constraints or additional symbolic analysis shows that the maximum possible value of nbytes is greater than the destination size.)
   
4. Final notes:
   • Ensure that your diagnostic message is short and clear.
   • Use the provided utility function EvaluateExprToInt to handle constant evaluation of the nbytes argument and getArraySizeFromExpr to determine the destination’s capacity.
   • Do not perform extra alias tracking or branch condition analysis; your focus is on validating that the buffer size in copy_from_user is properly constrained.

Following this plan will let you write a concise checker that flags cases where a fixed-size kernel buffer is used in a copy_from_user call without restricting the number of bytes to be copied.
