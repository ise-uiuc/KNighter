## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is copying data from user space into a fixed-size kernel buffer without constraining the number of bytes to the bufferâ€™s capacity. In this case, using copy_from_user() with a user-supplied length (nbytes) greater than the available size of the kernel buffer can lead to a buffer overflow. The correct approach restricts the number of bytes copied (using min() with the buffer size minus one) to prevent this overflow vulnerability.
