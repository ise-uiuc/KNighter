Your plan here

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No need for custom program state maps (like PtrAliasMap or UninitMemoryMap) because this checker solely examines the call arguments of copy_from_user.  
   • You can work directly in the checkPreCall callback without extra state tracking.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept all calls since you need to inspect every call to copy_from_user.

3. Implementation Steps in checkPreCall:
   a. Detect the Call:
      • In checkPreCall, check if the callee identifier’s name equals "copy_from_user".
   b. Retrieve Arguments:
      • Extract the destination buffer argument (the first parameter).
      • Extract the copy size argument (typically the third parameter).
   c. Determine Fixed-Size Destination:
      • Use getArraySizeFromExpr to attempt to retrieve the fixed size of the destination array.
      • If successful, store the fixed size (say, ArraySize).
   d. Check for Proper Bounds:
      • Analyze the copy size argument:
         – First, try using EvaluateExprToInt to see if it is a constant. If it evaluates to an integer constant, compare it with ArraySize (subtract 1 if necessary for null termination).
         – If the constant copy size is greater than the available buffer size, then the call is unsafe.
      • If the copy size isn’t a constant or evaluation fails, then use utility function ExprHasName on the copy size expression to check if its source text contains a call to "min". This may indicate that a proper bounds check has been applied.
   e. Emit a Bug Report:
      • If no min() check is detected and/or the evaluated copy size exceeds the fixed buffer size, generate a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short, clear message like "Buffer overflow in copy_from_user: user copy size exceeds fixed buffer size."

4. Summary:
   • Use checkPreCall to filter copy_from_user calls.
   • Use getArraySizeFromExpr to obtain the fixed buffer size.
   • Evaluate the third argument using EvaluateExprToInt and/or check its source text using ExprHasName to detect the absence of min() bounds checks.
   • Report the potential buffer overflow if the size check is missing or if nbytes is too large.

Follow these steps clearly in your checker implementation to detect this bug pattern in a simple and effective way.
