Your plan here

1. Decide on the Use of Program States:
   • No custom program state is strictly necessary since the bug pattern only involves verifying that the length argument in copy_from_user() is bounded by the destination buffer and is not tainted by an unbounded user-provided value. Pointer aliasing is not the focus here, so we do not need to register any program state maps.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept calls to copy_from_user().
   • Optionally, you may also use checkASTCodeBody to scan functions that have debugfs_write-like implementations, but checkPreCall is the simplest approach.

3. Implementation Steps in checkPreCall:
   • Identify the call:
     – In checkPreCall, check if the callee’s name matches "copy_from_user". You can retrieve the callee name from the CallEvent.
   
   • Retrieve Call Arguments:
     – Extract the call arguments; the first argument is the destination buffer and the third argument represents the length (nbytes).
     – For the destination argument, if it appears to be a DeclRefExpr (by invoking getArraySizeFromExpr on it), retrieve the fixed-size buffer size.
   
   • Analyze the Length Expression:
     – Obtain the expression for the length argument. Use the utility function ExprHasName to see if it contains "min(" (or similar) indicating that a bounded value is used.
     – Alternatively, if the argument is a simple identifier (like "nbytes") and it does not include a min() call, then this is a red flag because the user-supplied length is used directly.
     – (Optionally) Use EvaluateExprToInt on the length argument to see if it is a constant; if it is a nonconstant or greater-than-the-buffer-size constant, report the issue.
   
   • Report the Bug:
     – If the length argument proves unbounded (i.e. does not include a min() check and it is larger than the destination buffer size, or if it remains nonconstant and hence potentially unsafe), generate a bug report.
     – Create a short, clear message (e.g., "Unbounded copy_from_user length may lead to buffer overflow") and use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) to emit the warning.

4. Summary:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept copy_from_user calls.
   • Analyze the length argument: compare it against the buffer size (if available via getArraySizeFromExpr) and check its source text for a “min(” wrapper.
   • If the value is not properly bounded, report the potential buffer overflow.
   
This concise plan uses only checkPreCall and the provided helper functions (getArraySizeFromExpr and ExprHasName) to achieve the goal with minimal complexity.
