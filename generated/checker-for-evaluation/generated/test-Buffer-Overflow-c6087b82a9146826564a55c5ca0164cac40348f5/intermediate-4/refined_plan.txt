Your plan here

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • In this checker the goal is to verify that the number of bytes passed to copy_from_user does not exceed the destination buffer size. You don’t need to track aliasing or mark regions over time. Therefore, no custom program state maps are essential for this checker.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept calls to copy_from_user.
   • (Optionally) Use checkBind if you want to further track the destination pointer’s aliasing. However, for the simplest solution this isn’t necessary.

3. Implementation steps:
   a. In checkPreCall, inspect every function call:
      - Retrieve the function name (using the CallEvent’s callee identifier) and check if it matches "copy_from_user".
   
   b. Extract function call arguments:
      - Retrieve the first argument representing the destination pointer.
      - Retrieve the third argument representing the number of bytes (nbytes).
   
   c. Determine the destination buffer size:
      - Use getArraySizeFromExpr on the destination pointer expression. This should yield the fixed size of the destination buffer if it is a constant array (for example, “mybuf” declared as char mybuf[64]).
      - If getArraySizeFromExpr does not succeed (e.g., if the destination is not a constant array), then skip reporting.
   
   d. Evaluate the nbytes argument:
      - Use EvaluateExprToInt to compute the integer value of nbytes.
      - If evaluation fails, skip further checking.
   
   e. Compare the nbytes value to the destination buffer size:
      - Perform an integer comparison: if nbytes is greater than the destination buffer size then it indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
      - Note: You may want to consider any off-by-one issues (for example, when the code subtracts 1) but for this checker look for cases where no limit is imposed and nbytes clearly exceeds the buffer size.
   
   f. Report the bug:
      - If the condition (nbytes > destination buffer size) is satisfied, generate a bug report.
      - Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short, clear message like "Buffer overflow risk: copy_from_user copies more bytes than the destination buffer size" to report the bug.

4. Final remarks:
   • The plan is simple: use checkPreCall to analyze call parameters, use utility functions to extract the buffer size and evaluate nbytes, and if the bounds check is absent then report an issue.
   • Keep the implementation minimal and focused on comparing the statically known size of the destination array with the computed nbytes value.
