Your plan here

1. Callback Registration:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept every function call.
   • No new program state maps are necessary for this simple check.

2. Identifying the Faulty Function:
   • In checkPreCall, examine the CallEvent’s callee name.
   • If the callee’s name equals "copy_from_user" (using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() or similar), then continue; otherwise, ignore the event.

3. Extracting and Checking the Arguments:
   • Retrieve the first argument of the call, which is the destination buffer.
   • Invoke the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr on the destination expression. This should return the fixed size of the local array (for example, 64 for mybuf). If the helper fails it means the destination is not a fixed-sized array so you can exit.
   • Retrieve the third argument of the call – this is the user-provided length (nbytes).
   • Use EvaluateExprToInt on the length argument to see if its value can be determined statically.
   • If a concrete length value is obtained, compare it with the destination buffer’s size (or, more precisely, the maximum number of bytes allowed in the array—e.g., sizeof(buffer) or (sizeof(buffer) - 1) when a null-terminator is needed).
   • If the provided length exceeds the buffer size, then the bug pattern is present.

4. Bug Reporting:
   • If the destination buffer’s size is exceeded by the length argument, use a reporting mechanism (for example, create a short bug message like "Unchecked length in copy_from_user may overflow fixed buffer") using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.
   • Emit the bug report at the detected call site.

5. Summary:
   • The checker will simply monitor all calls to copy_from_user using checkPreCall.
   • It will use utility functions (EvaluateExprToInt and getArraySizeFromExpr) to extract the fixed buffer size and the user-supplied number of bytes.
   • A straightforward comparison between the two will trigger a bug report if the provided length is larger than the buffer.
   • By following these steps, the checker detects the bug pattern while remaining simple and clear.

This concise, step-by-step plan should allow you to implement the checker with minimal code using the provided utilities and Clang check callbacks.
