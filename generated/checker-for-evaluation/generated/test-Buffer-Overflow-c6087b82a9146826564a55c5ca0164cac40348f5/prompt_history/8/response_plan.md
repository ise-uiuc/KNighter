Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide on Program State Requirements:
   • In this checker, you do not need to register any custom program state (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE). This checker only needs to inspect the AST of the call to copy_from_user() and its arguments.  
   • No pointer aliasing or tainting maps are needed.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept function calls.
   • In checkPreCall, check if the callee’s name is "copy_from_user".

3. Detailed Steps for checkPreCall:
   • Verify the callee:
     – Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() to get the function name. If it equals "copy_from_user", proceed.
   • Retrieve Relevant Arguments:
     – Extract the destination argument (argument index 0) and the size argument (argument index 2) from the CallEvent.
   • Obtain the Destination Buffer Size:
     – Using the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr, pass the destination argument. This function will attempt to derive the statically declared size (e.g. char mybuf[64]). If the destination is not a fixed-size local array, then you can skip further checks.
   • Analyze the Size Parameter Expression:
     – Use the provided utility function ExprHasName on the size argument’s AST node to see whether it contains “min”. In the fixed patch, the size argument is computed as “min(nbytes, sizeof(mybuf) - 1)”. If ExprHasName finds “min” in the expression, then the check is safe.
     – Otherwise, if the size argument does not invoke “min”, then the unchecked user-supplied nbytes may lead to an overflow.
   • Report the Diagnostic:
     – If the size argument is not appropriately capped by a call to “min”, generate a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short, clear message such as "Unchecked copy_from_user detected; potential buffer overflow".
     – Emit this report through the CheckerContext.

4. Implementation Summary:
   • In checkPreCall:
     – First, check if the function name equals “copy_from_user”.
     – Next, retrieve arguments – specifically the destination buffer (argument 0) and user-provided size (argument 2).
     – Use getArraySizeFromExpr to get the fixed array size of the destination buffer. If this fails, the checker can bail out (the bug pattern specifically concerns copy_from_user writing to a fixed-size buffer).
     – Use ExprHasName on the size expression with the string “min”. If "min" is not found, flag a potential bug.
     – Generate and emit a bug report.

This concise plan should let you implement the checker with minimal steps while ensuring that every call to copy_from_user() is examined for proper size capping.
