Your plan here

1. Decide if customization of program states is needed:
   • In this case, no persistent program state maps are required because the check only needs to inspect the arguments of copy_from_user during the call event. Pointer aliasing or tainting isn’t needed.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept calls to copy_from_user.
   • Optionally, if you want to inspect surrounding context (for more complex heuristics), you may also use checkBind to track the destination buffer, but for this simple checker, checkPreCall is sufficient.

3. Implementation steps in checkPreCall:
   • When checkPreCall is invoked, check if the call’s callee identifier is "copy_from_user". If not, exit.
   
   • Obtain the three arguments of the call:
       – The first argument is the destination buffer (kernel buffer).
       – The third argument is the number of bytes to copy.
   
   • Use the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr on the destination buffer expression. If it returns true, you now have the total buffer size.
       – Compute the allowed maximum safe copy size as (buffer size – 1).
   
   • Inspect the third argument:
       – If the third argument is a call to the min() function (or appears as a computed expression that constrains the copy size), you can consider it safe and do nothing.
       – Otherwise, use EvaluateExprToInt to determine if its value (if it can be evaluated to an integer constant) exceeds the allowed maximum. (Note: it’s acceptable if evaluation fails, in which case a potential issue should be flagged.)
   
   • If the evaluated copy size is found to be larger than the allowed maximum, generate a bug report:
       – Create a short and clear message (like “Buffer overflow in copy_from_user: size exceeds destination capacity”).
       – Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) and call C.emitReport(...) to report the bug.

4. Summary of key steps:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept copy_from_user calls.
   • Extract the destination pointer (using getArraySizeFromExpr) and determine its size.
   • Evaluate the copy size argument (third argument) to ensure that it does not exceed (buffer size – 1), or that it is properly constrained (e.g. via min()).
   • Emit a bug report if the check fails.

Following these concrete steps using the provided utility functions will allow you to implement a concise checker that alerts for the improper use of copy_from_user where the destination buffer’s boundary isn’t correctly enforced.
