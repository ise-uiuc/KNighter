1. Identify and Hook the Potential Bug Call:
   • Register the checker to intercept function calls using the checkPreCall callback.
   • In checkPreCall, check if the callee’s name is "copy_from_user" (e.g. via Call.getCalleeIdentifier().getName()).
   • If the call is to copy_from_user, proceed with further analysis.

2. Extract and Evaluate the Critical Arguments:
   • Retrieve the argument that is the destination buffer (the first parameter of copy_from_user).
   • Retrieve the third argument which represents the number of bytes (nbytes) that the function will copy.
   • Use EvaluateExprToInt to evaluate the nbytes argument to an integer. If evaluation fails, then skip the check.

3. Obtain the Fixed-Size Destination Buffer Capacity:
   • Use the getArraySizeFromExpr utility on the destination buffer expression to check if it is a constant array.
   • If getArraySizeFromExpr returns true, you obtain the buffer’s size (for example, for a char mybuf[64], the size is 64).

4. Compare and Detect the Overflow Risk:
   • Since the destination buffer might reserve one byte for a terminator (or safe usage), subtract 1 from the array size to get the maximum allowed copy size.
   • Compare the evaluated nbytes with (arraySize - 1). If nbytes is greater than (arraySize - 1), then it is a potential bug leading to buffer overflow.

5. Report the Bug:
   • When the check determines that nbytes exceeds the fixed buffer’s safe capacity, create a non-fatal error node.
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to report the bug. Use a short and clear message, for example: "copy_from_user copies more bytes than destination buffer capacity" or similar.

6. No Need for Custom Program States:
   • Since this check does not involve tracking pointer aliasing or taint propagation across multiple calls, you do not need to register any custom program state maps or alias maps.
   • Direct analysis within the checkPreCall callback is sufficient to analyze the size argument versus the fixed destination buffer.

By following these steps concretely in the checkPreCall callback, you will be able to detect instances where a call to copy_from_user copies more bytes than what the fixed-size buffer can hold, which is the essence of the targeted bug pattern.
