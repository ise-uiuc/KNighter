Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:  
 • In this checker the bug is a code-level pattern inside a single function. You do not need to track pointer aliasing or tainting via program state maps. Instead, you can perform a simple AST analysis on the function’s body.  

2. Choose callback functions:  
 • Use checkASTCodeBody to inspect the body of the “btrfs_close_one_device” function.

3. In checkASTCodeBody when processing a FunctionDecl:  
 a. Filter the FunctionDecl so that you only process functions whose name is “btrfs_close_one_device”.  
 b. Traverse its CompoundStmt body to locate the call to btrfs_close_bdev (using findSpecificTypeInChildren to get the CallExpr of btrfs_close_bdev).  
 c. Once btrfs_close_bdev is found and executed, inspect the subsequent statements (or the overall statement sequence) to check for an assignment that nullifies the “bdev_file” field.  
  – Use an AST traversal (or helper like findSpecificTypeInChildren) to search for a BinaryOperator or an assignment expression where the LHS is a MemberExpr referring to “bdev_file” (you can use ExprHasName to check if the source text of the LHS contains “bdev_file”)  
  – Also verify that the RHS is a null pointer constant (e.g., “NULL” or “0”).  
 d. If you cannot find such an assignment that sets device->bdev_file to NULL after calling btrfs_close_bdev, then it indicates the vulnerability.  

4. Report the bug:  
 • In checkASTCodeBody, if the pointer is not nullified, generate a non-fatal error node and create a bug report with a short, clear message such as “Dangling pointer: bdev_file not nullified”. Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> for reporting.

This concise plan leverages the AST inspection provided by checkASTCodeBody and the utility functions (like findSpecificTypeInChildren and ExprHasName) to locate the problematic pattern.
