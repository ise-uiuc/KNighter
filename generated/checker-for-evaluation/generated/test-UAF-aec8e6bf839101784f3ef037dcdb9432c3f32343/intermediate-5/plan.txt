1. CUSTOMIZE PROGRAM STATE  
   • REGISTER a map to track the reset state of the bdev_file pointer.  
     – For example, use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(BdevFileResetMap, const MemRegion*, bool) where the boolean value represents whether device->bdev_file has been cleared (true) or not (false).  
   • (Optional) REGISTER a pointer alias map (PtrAliasMap) to track aliasing of the device structure if needed for more complex pointer analyses.

2. CHOOSE THE CALLBACK FUNCTIONS  
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to hook onto the body of functions so that we can scan the implementation of btrfs_close_one_device.  
   • Use checkBind to track pointer assignments within btrfs_close_one_device.  
   • Use checkBranchCondition if necessary to detect later usage (e.g., in potential if (device->bdev_file) conditions in functions like __btrfs_free_extra_devids) but the simplest approach will be intraprocedural: check btrfs_close_one_device for proper reset.

3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS  
   A. In checkASTCodeBody:  
      – First, check if the analyzed function’s name is "btrfs_close_one_device".  
      – Traverse its body to locate the key resource release calls:
         • Look for the call to btrfs_close_bdev(device) (which frees the block device) and fput() calls with device->bdev_file as an argument.
      – Simultaneously, scan for any assignment (using checkBind events or a simple AST traversal) that sets device->bdev_file to a value.  
         • If you detect an assignment where the left-hand side involves “bdev_file” and the right-hand side is a NULL literal, update the BdevFileResetMap entry for the corresponding MemRegion to true.
      – If the function calls fput(device->bdev_file) and/or frees the resource but no subsequent assignment resetting device->bdev_file to NULL is found, mark the region as not reset (i.e. false).

   B. In checkBind:  
      – Monitor binding events in btrfs_close_one_device.  
      – When you see an assignment whose source text (using ExprHasName) contains “bdev_file”, check the right-hand side.  
         • If the RHS represents a NULL constant, update the program state for that pointer (via the BdevFileResetMap) as properly cleared.
         • Make sure to also propagate the state to any aliases using the PtrAliasMap, if you decide to use it.

   C. Bug Reporting  
      – At the end of btrfs_close_one_device (you can use checkASTCodeBody’s traversal end or checkEndFunction if the function returns), retrieve the reset flag from your program state for device->bdev_file.  
      – If the flag is false (i.e., the pointer was not reset after free), generate a non-fatal bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short, clear message such as “Dangling pointer: device->bdev_file is not reset to NULL after free.”  
      – Emit this bug report.

4. SUMMARY  
   – The checker intercepts the implementation of btrfs_close_one_device via checkASTCodeBody.  
   – It uses checkBind to track assignments to the bdev_file field.  
   – A program state map (BdevFileResetMap) is set up to keep track of whether the pointer was reset after being used for resource release.  
   – At the end of the function’s analysis, if the map indicates that bdev_file was not reset to NULL, the checker reports a potential use-after-free error.  

Following these concrete steps will help you implement the checker in a simple and direct way to detect the bug pattern described.
