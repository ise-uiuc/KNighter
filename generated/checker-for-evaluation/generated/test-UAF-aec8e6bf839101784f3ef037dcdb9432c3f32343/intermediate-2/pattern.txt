## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is failing to clear or invalidate a pointer after its associated resource has been released. In this patch, the block device file pointer (device->bdev_file) is not set to NULL after the file has been closed and freed, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability when the code later checks the pointer and attempts to dereference it.
