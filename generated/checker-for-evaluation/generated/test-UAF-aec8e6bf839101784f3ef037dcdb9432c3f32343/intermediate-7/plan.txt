Your plan is as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program State Customizations

• REGISTER a program state map (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(BdevFileStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) to track the state of the “bdev_file” pointer.  
 – The bool flag is set to true if the pointer is live (not freed) and false if it has been freed.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Implementation Details

A. Detecting Resource Freeing  
 • Use checkPostCall to intercept calls to btrfs_close_bdev.  
  – In checkPostCall, if the callee is btrfs_close_bdev, retrieve the device pointer.  
  – From the device, get the “bdev_file” field’s underlying MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr or manually by accessing the member expression).  
  – Update BdevFileStateMap to mark that region as freed (set the value to false).  

B. Tracking Assignment to Pointer  
 • Use checkBind to intercept bindings involving the “bdev_file” member.  
  – In checkBind, examine LHS expressions to see if they refer to device->bdev_file.  
  – If the RHS is a null pointer constant (you might check using isNull or by comparing to 0), update BdevFileStateMap to mark the region as “null” (i.e. not live).  
  – Also use checkBind to propagate alias information if needed via a PtrAliasMap, though in this simple checker tracking bdev_file directly is sufficient.

C. Detecting Unsafe Use  
 • Use checkBranchCondition to monitor the evaluation of conditional expressions.  
  – When encountering an if-statement that uses device->bdev_file as the condition (e.g., if (device->bdev_file)), extract the underlying MemRegion of bdev_file using getMemRegionFromExpr.  
  – Lookup the region in BdevFileStateMap.  
  – If the state indicates the pointer was freed (flag is false) but is still non-null, then generate a bug report ("UAF: use after free of bdev_file").  
  – Use C.emitReport or create a bug report via std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short, clear message.

---------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of Checker Steps

• Register the BdevFileStateMap in your checker’s initialization (in the constructor).  
• In checkPostCall, upon intercepting btrfs_close_bdev, mark the associated bdev_file region in the program state as freed.  
• In checkBind, look for assignments to the bdev_file member – if it is set to NULL, update the program state accordingly so that later uses will not trigger false positives.  
• In checkBranchCondition, for conditions checking device->bdev_file, look it up in the state map; if the pointer is still non-null and flagged as freed, report the potential UAF bug.

---------------------------------------------------------
By following these steps and using the provided utility functions (such as getMemRegionFromExpr, findSpecificTypeInParents/Children, and the program state map registration macros), you can write a clear, concise checker that detects the use‐after‐free error associated with not nullifying device->bdev_file.
