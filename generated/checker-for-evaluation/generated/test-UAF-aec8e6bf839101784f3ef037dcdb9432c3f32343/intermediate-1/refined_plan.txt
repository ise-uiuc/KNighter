Your plan is organized as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Register Program State Maps

• Use a program state map to track the “freed but not nulled” status for the pointer. For example, register a map:
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreeStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
This map will record each pointer (i.e. the MemRegion representing device->bdev_file) that has been freed (for example, via a call to fput) without being reset to NULL.

• (Optionally) Register an alias‐map (PtrAliasMap) to track pointer aliasing if the pointer is copied. This can help if the same freed region is bound to multiple variables.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Their Implementation

A. checkPostCall (for detecting resource free)
 • In checkPostCall, intercept function calls.
 • If the called function is “fput” (or any relevant free function):
  – Retrieve the call’s parameter (using getMemRegionFromExpr) for the pointer being freed.
  – If the pointer belongs to the field “device->bdev_file,” mark it in FreeStateMap as true.
  – (If managing aliases, update PtrAliasMap so that any alias of this region is also marked.)

B. checkBind (for tracking pointer reset)
 • In checkBind, monitor assignments to pointers.
 • Check if the left-hand side of an assignment is the field “device->bdev_file.”
 • Then inspect the right-hand side expression:
  – If the assignment is setting it to “NULL” (using a literal or symbolic constant comparison),
   remove the entry from the FreeStateMap (or mark it as false).
  – Also update aliasing information in the PtrAliasMap so that all aliases are cleared.
 • This ensures that when the pointer is correctly nulled after freeing, the checker no longer raises a warning.

C. checkLocation (for identifying misuse)
 • In checkLocation, intercept pointer dereferences and other accesses.
 • When a location (SVal Loc) is read from, check if its corresponding MemRegion is in the FreeStateMap with a “true” flag.
 • If the pointer is used (e.g. in condition checks, dereferences) while still flagged as freed,
  report a bug.
 • Create a non‐fatal bug node and emit a short, clear bug report (e.g., “Use-after-free: pointer not reset to NULL after free”) using the PathSensitiveBugReport or BasicBugReport interface.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of the Steps

 1. Program State Setup:
  – Register FreeStateMap (and optionally PtrAliasMap) to track device->bdev_file states.

 2. On fput Call (checkPostCall):
  – When fput is called, obtain the MemRegion from the pointer argument.
  – Mark that region in FreeStateMap as “freed.”

 3. On Pointer Assignment (checkBind):
  – When the pointer field device->bdev_file is assigned,
   if the RHS is NULL, remove or clear the mapping in FreeStateMap.
  – Track pointer aliasing if the pointer is copied.

 4. On Pointer Use (checkLocation):
  – If a read or use of a pointer occurs while its region has a “freed” flag in FreeStateMap,
   emit a bug report indicating a potential use-after-free due to not resetting the pointer to NULL.

--------------------------------------------------

Follow this plan step by step. With these concrete callbacks and program state management, you can detect when the pointer (device->bdev_file) is freed (via fput) but not properly set to NULL, thus leading to potential use-after-free errors.
