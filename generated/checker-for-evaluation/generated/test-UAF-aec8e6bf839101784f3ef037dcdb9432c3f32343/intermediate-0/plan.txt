Your plan here

1. Decide on program state customization:
   • No custom program state maps are necessary because we can perform a direct AST analysis on the function body of btrfs_close_one_device.
   • Pointer aliasing tracking is not required for this checker since we only need to verify that the “bdev_file” field is set to NULL after being freed.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to inspect the function definition of btrfs_close_one_device.
   • Optionally, use checkBind if you want to track assignment operations for the structure’s fields, but a simple AST traversal in checkASTCodeBody is sufficient.
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept any use (or extra free’s) of the field later, but this can be omitted if analysis is limited to btrfs_close_one_device.

3. Implementation steps in detail:
   Step 1 – Filter the target function:
     • In checkASTCodeBody, inspect every function declaration.
     • Identify the function “btrfs_close_one_device” by checking the function’s name.

   Step 2 – Locate the resource release:
     • Traverse the function body (a CompoundStmt) to find the call expression to btrfs_close_bdev (using utility routines like findSpecificTypeInChildren).
     • Record that the bdev resource has been closed in this branch.

   Step 3 – Verify pointer clearance:
     • After the call to btrfs_close_bdev, examine the subsequent statements, especially inside the “if (device->bdev)” branch.
     • Look for an assignment statement where the struct field “device->bdev_file” is set to NULL.
     • This can be done by iterating over the children of the CompoundStmt or by using an AST matcher that looks for a BinaryOperator (or equivalent AST node) where the left-hand side accesses device->bdev_file and the right-hand side is a NULL literal.
     • Use the utility function ExprHasName if needed to check if the assignment text contains “bdev_file” and “NULL”.

   Step 4 – Report bug:
     • If no assignment setting “device->bdev_file” to NULL is found after the call to btrfs_close_bdev, then generate a bug report.
     • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short, clear message like: “Dangling pointer: bdev_file not reset after free.”
     • Emit the bug report through the CheckerContext (using C.emitReport).

4. Final remarks:
   • This plan uses a simple direct AST analysis of a specific function body. It avoids extra complicated state tracking and alias map registration.
   • The analysis is limited to the scope of btrfs_close_one_device, ensuring simplicity and clarity.
   • By following these steps and using the provided utility functions where appropriate, you can implement a checker that reliably reports the bug pattern of failing to reset a pointer to a resource after it has been freed.

This is your detailed plan for writing the checker.
