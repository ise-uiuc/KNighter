## Bug Pattern

Failure to nullify a pointer after its resource has been freed. In this case, even after the associated block device file has been released (via fput()), the pointer (device->bdev_file) is not set to NULL. As a result, subsequent code may incorrectly assume the resource is still valid and attempt to use or free it again, leading to a use-after-free bug.
