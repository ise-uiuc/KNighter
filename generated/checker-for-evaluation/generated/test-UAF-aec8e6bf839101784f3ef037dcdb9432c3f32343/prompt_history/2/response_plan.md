1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • In this case there is no need to introduce a new program state map (like REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) or pointer aliasing information since the bug pattern can be detected by simply inspecting the AST body of the function btrfs_close_one_device.
   • We will instead scan for the key events within the function body.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to process the definition of function btrfs_close_one_device.
   • (Optionally) Use checkPostCall if you want to inspect individual calls within the function—however, the simplest approach is to traverse the function’s AST in checkASTCodeBody.

3. Detailed implementation steps:
   • In checkASTCodeBody, check whether the current FunctionDecl has the name "btrfs_close_one_device". (Hint: compare getNameAsString() with "btrfs_close_one_device".)
   • If it is the target function, traverse its body (i.e. its compound statement):
       - Look for a call to fput (or any similar function that frees a resource) where the argument is a member access for the pointer “bdev_file”.
       - Set a flag (e.g., fputCallFound) when such a call is found.
       - Also, look for an assignment (via a binary operator or a declaration with initialization) where the left-hand side is the same field “bdev_file” and the right-hand side is the null literal.
       - Set another flag (e.g., pointerCleared) when this assignment is encountered.
   • After traversing the function body:
       - If fputCallFound is true (indicating that the resource is released) but pointerCleared is false (indicating that the pointer is not reset to NULL), then report a bug.
       - Use a bug reporting API (like std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a short, clear message like "Pointer not cleared after free" or "use-after-free: cleared pointer missing").
   • Emit the bug report at the appropriate location in the AST.

4. Summary:
   • We are using checkASTCodeBody to detect the pattern within the specific function.
   • The AST traversal focuses on two things: (1) detecting a free operation on device->bdev_file (via fput call) and (2) verifying that an assignment to set device->bdev_file to NULL exists afterward.
   • No additional state maps (or pointer aliasing maps) are needed, keeping the checker simple and straightforward.

This plan provides clear, few steps to implement the checker with concrete guidance on which callback to use and what to check for.
