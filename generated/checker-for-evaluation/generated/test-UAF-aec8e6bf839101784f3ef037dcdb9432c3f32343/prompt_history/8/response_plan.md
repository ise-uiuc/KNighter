1. Customize program state:
   • REGISTER a map (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(NullifiedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) to record whether a device’s “bdev_file” field has been nullified.
   • Optionally, register a pointer alias map (PtrAliasMap) to track aliases of the “bdev_file” region. (This helps if the field is later copied to another variable.)

2. Choose callback functions and implement the detection steps:
   • In checkBind:
     – Intercept binding events in assignment expressions.
     – Look for assignments where the left‐hand side’s source text contains “bdev_file” (using utility function ExprHasName).
     – If the right‐hand side is a null literal, update the NullifiedMap by binding the corresponding MemRegion (obtained via getMemRegionFromExpr) to true.
     – Also, update any aliases in PtrAliasMap so that all pointers referring to “bdev_file” are marked as nullified.

   • In checkPreCall:
     – Intercept calls to functions that free resources (e.g., fput).
     – Examine the call’s argument. If its source text contains “bdev_file”, retrieve its MemRegion.
     – Query the NullifiedMap. If this region is not recorded as nullified (or recorded as false), then this indicates a potential use-after-free because the resource was freed but the pointer was not set to NULL.
     – If the check fails, generate a bug report with a short message such as "Use-after-free: bdev_file not nullified after free" (using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>).

   • In checkASTCodeBody (if needed):
     – Optionally, inspect the body of the function “btrfs_close_one_device”. Scan for an assignment to “device->bdev_file”. If such an assignment (to NULL) is missing in this context after the free call to fput, then this is another indication of the bug pattern.
     – This method can complement checkBind by statically ensuring that the pointer is nullified in the function body.

3. Bug Reporting:
   • When a call to fput (or similar free function) is reached and the passed “bdev_file” pointer is still non-NULL according to the NullifiedMap, generate a nonfatal error node and a bug report.
   • Make sure the bug report message is concise and clear.

This plan uses two main callbacks (checkBind for tracking assignments and checkPreCall for detecting improper resource release) along with program state mappings to track nullification status and pointer aliases. Follow these steps concretely to detect the bug pattern of “not nullifying a pointer (bdev_file) after free” and prevent the potential use-after-free.
