1. Customize Program States:
   • Use a program state map (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ReleasedPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) to record whether a device’s “bdev_file” field has been released (true) or reset (false).

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. In checkPostCall:
      • Intercept calls to the function “btrfs_close_bdev”.
      • When such a call is detected, retrieve the device passed as an argument.
      • Use a helper (for instance, by searching in the device’s AST node via findSpecificTypeInChildren or by retrieving the region from the field “bdev_file” using getMemRegionFromExpr) to get the MemRegion corresponding to device->bdev_file.
      • Update the ReleasedPtrMap for that region to true, indicating that the resource has been released (freed).

   B. In checkBind:
      • Monitor bindings (assignments) to the “bdev_file” field using checkBind.
      • When a bind occurs on a field with name “bdev_file”, inspect the bound value.
      • If the value is set to NULL (or its equivalent), update the ReleasedPtrMap for the corresponding region to false. This marks that the stale pointer has been reset.
      • Use utility functions (and possibly ExprHasName to check for “bdev_file”) to isolate the binding for that pointer field.

   C. In checkBranchCondition:
      • Hook the branch conditions (via checkBranchCondition) to catch the use of “bdev_file” in an if-statement.
      • Within the condition’s AST, look for a MemberExpr whose field name is “bdev_file” (you may use ExprHasName to look for the text “bdev_file”).
      • If such an expression is found, retrieve its MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr).
      • Consult the ReleasedPtrMap: if the record for this region is true (indicating that the resource has been freed but the pointer was not reset), then emit a bug report (via generateNonFatalErrorNode with a short message like “Stale pointer use: bdev_file not reset after free”) using a PathSensitiveBugReport.
      
3. Reporting:
   • When a violation is detected in checkBranchCondition, quickly create and emit a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport with a clear short message.
   
By following these three steps (customizing program state, intercepting critical calls, and checking branch conditions), you can straightforwardly implement a checker that detects the bug pattern of not resetting a pointer after its associated resource has been released.
