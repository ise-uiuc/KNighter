Your plan here

1. Customize Program State
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool): This map will track whether a pointer (specifically the bdev_file field) has been freed (set to true) but not yet nullified.
   • Optionally, REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*): This can be used to track aliasing relationships so that if one pointer is cleared then its aliases are also updated.

2. Callback: checkPostCall (for Function Calls)
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to fput.
   • When the callee name is "fput", retrieve the argument’s expression representing the pointer (likely device->bdev_file) using our utility function getMemRegionFromExpr.
   • Update FreedPtrMap for the corresponding MemRegion by marking it as freed (set true).
   • This step models that a free operation occurred but the pointer may still be live.

3. Callback: checkBind (for Pointer Bindings)
   • In checkBind, monitor assignments to the pointer.
   • If a binding sets the target pointer (device->bdev_file) to NULL (i.e., the value is a null constant), then search for its corresponding MemRegion.
   • Clear the entry from FreedPtrMap (or mark it as not freed) so that future checks do not report an error.
   • Also update PtrAliasMap so that any alias of the freed pointer also gets cleared.

4. Callback: checkLocation (for Pointer Usage)
   • In checkLocation, when the pointer is loaded or dereferenced, retrieve its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
   • Look up the region in FreedPtrMap.
   • If the region is marked as freed (true) and has not been nullified, then generate a bug report.
   • The report message should be short and clear (for example, "Freed resource pointer not set to NULL" or similar).

5. Reporting the Bug
   • When the checker finds that a pointer flagged in FreedPtrMap is subsequently used (via checkLocation), generate a nonfatal error node and emit a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with the short message.
  
Following this plan and using the provided utility functions will let you write a checker that detects cases where a resource (like device->bdev_file) is freed but not nullified, leading to potential use-after-free bugs.
