Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Customized Program States

• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedPointerMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  – This map will track memory regions representing pointer members (specifically “bdev_file”) that have been freed without a following “nullify” assignment.  
• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)  
  – Use this to track aliases of the tracked pointer so that marking one as nullified updates its aliases as well.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Implementation Steps

A. Free Function Detection (checkPreCall)
 • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to functions that free resources (for example, fput).  
 • Use getNameAsString or ExprHasName on the callee/argument to check if the pointer argument comes from “bdev_file”.  
 • If the argument is indeed a pointer to “bdev_file”, retrieve its MemRegion by calling getMemRegionFromExpr.  
 • Update FreedPointerMap in the program state: mark the region as “freed but not nullified” (set the bool flag true).

B. Tracking Nullification Assignments (checkBind)
 • In checkBind, watch for assignments where a pointer is bound to a constant null value.  
 • Specifically, detect when “bdev_file” (or an alias tracked in PtrAliasMap) is assigned with a null literal.  
 • Upon detecting a null-assignment, update FreedPointerMap for the corresponding region (or its alias) to indicate the pointer has been nullified (set the flag false or remove the entry).  
 • Also update the PtrAliasMap accordingly so that all aliases become marked.

C. Use-After-Free Detection at Pointer Usage (checkLocation or checkBranchCondition)
 • In checkLocation (or within checkBranchCondition when processing an expression like “if (device->bdev_file)”), detect usage of the “bdev_file” pointer.  
 • Retrieve its MemRegion via getMemRegionFromExpr.  
 • Consult FreedPointerMap: if the region is recorded as freed (flag is true), then the pointer has not been nullified before usage.  
 • Generate a bug report with a clear, short message (for example, “Pointer not nullified after free”) using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of Steps

• In checkPreCall, catch calls to fput (or similar free functions) on “bdev_file” and mark the corresponding region in FreedPointerMap as freed.  
• In checkBind, watch for assignments that set “bdev_file” to NULL; update FreedPointerMap (and PtrAliasMap) so that any freed pointer becomes marked as nullified.  
• In checkLocation (or checkBranchCondition), when “bdev_file” is later used (e.g. dereferenced or condition-checked), verify whether its region is still flagged as freed; if so, report a bug indicating a potential use-after-free.

--------------------------------------------------
This simple, step‐by‐step plan uses minimal callbacks and straightforward program state maps to check if a pointer (in this case “bdev_file”) is being used after it has been freed without being nullified. Follow these steps to implement the checker.
