```
1. Customize Program State:
   • Register a map called DevmAllocMap to track memory regions allocated using a devm_* function.
     Use: REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DevmAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
   • (Optional) Register a PtrAliasMap to track alias relationships if pointer assignments need deeper analysis.
     Use: REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)

2. Use checkPostCall to Track Device-Managed Allocations:
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to devm_kcalloc (or any devm_* functions if necessary).
   • Verify if the callee identifier equals "devm_kcalloc".
   • Retrieve the returned pointer’s MemRegion from the call.
   • Update the program state by marking this MemRegion as device-managed (e.g., set its value to true in DevmAllocMap).

3. Use checkPreCall to Detect Manual Free on Device-Managed Memory:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to manual free functions, specifically "pinctrl_utils_free_map" (or dt_free_map if applicable).
   • Retrieve the pointer argument from the call.
   • Extract its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
   • Consult the DevmAllocMap in the program state:
       – If the MemRegion is found and marked as device-managed, then it indicates a double free scenario.
   • Report the bug using a short bug report message (e.g., "Double free on device-managed memory").
     Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a clear message.

4. (Optional) Track Pointer Aliases with checkBind:
   • In checkBind, monitor pointer assignments (e.g., p2 = p1) to update the PtrAliasMap.
   • When a pointer is marked device-managed, propagate the tag to its aliases.
   • This ensures that if an alias is freed manually, the bug is still detected.

Summary:
By adding a DevmAllocMap in the program state and intercepting allocation calls in checkPostCall and free calls in checkPreCall, you can detect when memory allocated with devm_kcalloc is later freed manually, resulting in a double free. Use checkBind to improve pointer alias tracking if needed. The bug report message should be short and direct, alerting the developer about the improper mix of device-managed and manual deallocation.
