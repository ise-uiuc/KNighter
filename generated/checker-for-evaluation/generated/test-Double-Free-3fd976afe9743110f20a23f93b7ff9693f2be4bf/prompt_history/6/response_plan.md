Your plan should be structured as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program States  
--------------------------------------------------
• REGISTER a map to track if a pointer is allocated via a devm_* function.  
  – Use: REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DevmTaintMap, const MemRegion *, bool)  
  – This map will record a pointer’s underlying memory region and mark it as “tainted” (i.e. allocated automatically) if allocated with a devm_* API.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions  
--------------------------------------------------
• Use checkPostCall to intercept memory allocation calls.  
• Use checkPreCall to intercept the free/deallocation calls.  
• Use checkBind if necessary to track aliasing of pointer values.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Implement checkPostCall Callback (Modeling the Allocation)  
--------------------------------------------------
• In checkPostCall, detect if the callee is a devm_* allocator (e.g., devm_kcalloc).  
  – Compare the callee’s name against a list of devm_* functions.  
• If the function is a devm_* allocator:  
  – Retrieve the return value’s pointer expression using the CallEvent utilities.  
  – Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the return expression to get its MemRegion.  
  – Update the program state (DevmTaintMap) to map this MemRegion to true (tainted).  
  – This marks the memory as auto-managed and indicates that manual free should not be applied.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Implement checkPreCall Callback (Detecting Manual Deallocation)  
--------------------------------------------------
• In checkPreCall, look for calls to deallocation APIs that are used by manual free routines (e.g., pinctrl_utils_free_map).  
  – Check the callee’s name (or use ExprHasName utility) to determine if the call is a manual free.  
• For each pointer argument that is freed, do the following:  
  – Retrieve the corresponding MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.  
  – Lookup this region in the DevmTaintMap.  
  – If a match is found and it is marked as tainted, then report a bug.  
    – Generate a non-fatal error node and create a bug report with a concise message such as “Double free of devm_* allocated memory.”

--------------------------------------------------
5. (Optional) Track Pointer Aliases via checkBind  
--------------------------------------------------
• To handle aliasing, use checkBind to record whenever a pointer is assigned to another pointer.  
  – Update a PtrAliasMap (if one exists) in the program state so that taint information propagates among aliases.  
• When marking a pointer as tainted or checked in the DevmTaintMap, update all its aliases accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------
6. Summary of Steps  
--------------------------------------------------
• Create a program state (DevmTaintMap) to record pointers allocated via devm_kcalloc (or similar).  
• In checkPostCall, when a devm_* memory allocation is detected, retrieve its MemRegion and mark it as tainted.  
• In checkPreCall, when a manual free (e.g., pinctrl_utils_free_map) is detected, retrieve the memory region of the pointer argument and verify if it is tainted.  
• If a tainted region is being manually freed, issue a bug report with a short message indicating a double free vulnerability.  
• Optionally, use checkBind to maintain aliasing information to ensure that if any alias of the tainted pointer is manually freed, the bug is still caught.

This concise arrangement uses minimal steps to achieve the goal while ensuring the checker reliably catches the double free due to devm_* auto-managed allocations being freed manually.
