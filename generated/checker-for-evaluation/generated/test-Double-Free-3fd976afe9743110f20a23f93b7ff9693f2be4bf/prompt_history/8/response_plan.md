1. Customize Program State:
   • Define a Program State Map (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(TaintedAllocMap, const MemRegion *, bool)) to record memory regions allocated by a devm_* function.
   • Use this map to mark regions as “tainted” (i.e., allocated using device-managed APIs) when they are created.

2. Detect Device-Managed Allocations:
   • Use the checkPostCall callback to intercept calls.
   • In checkPostCall, check if the callee’s name is "devm_kcalloc" by examining Call.getCalleeIdentifier().
   • If the call is from devm_kcalloc, retrieve the returned pointer’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr.
   • Update the TaintedAllocMap to mark this region as tainted (true).

3. Track Manual Free Operations:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept calls to functions that perform manual freeing, for example, "pinctrl_utils_free_map".
   • In checkPreCall, verify if the current call is to a manual free function by comparing the callee’s name (using getCalleeIdentifier()).
   • Retrieve the memory region of the pointer argument that is being freed.
   • Use the TaintedAllocMap to check if this region (or any of its aliases) was previously allocated with a devm_* function.

4. Report the Bug:
   • If the memory region is marked as tainted when a manual free function is invoked, generate a diagnostic.
   • Use generateNonFatalErrorNode and std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) to report the double free with a concise message such as "Double free of devm_* allocated memory."

5. Pointer Aliasing (Optional but Recommended):
   • Optionally, use checkBind along with a separate alias map (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) to track pointer assignments.
   • When a pointer is assigned to another (aliasing), record this relation so that if one alias is tainted, the other is also considered tainted.
   • This will help in catching cases where the pointer being freed is not the original but an alias.

By following these steps, you will be able to detect cases where a memory region allocated by a devm_* function (in this case devm_kcalloc) is later manually deallocated, leading to a potential double free.
