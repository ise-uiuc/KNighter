Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program States

• REGISTER a program state map named TaintedMemMap that maps const MemRegion* to bool.  
  – This map flags memory regions allocated through a devm_* allocation function.  
  – Optionally, you may also register a pointer alias map (PtrAliasMap) using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to track aliases, ensuring that if one pointer is marked as coming from devm_*, its aliases are also marked.

------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

a. checkPostCall (for allocating functions)  
   – Intercept the call when a devm_* function (in our case devm_kcalloc) is invoked.  
   – In this callback, check if the callee identifier is "devm_kcalloc".  
   – If the condition is met, retrieve the returned pointer's MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and then record it in TaintedMemMap (marking it with true).  
   – This flags the memory as coming from an auto-managed allocation.

b. checkPreCall (for freeing functions)  
   – Intercept the call when a free function such as pinctrl_utils_free_map (or the chain via pinconf_generic_dt_free_map) is invoked.  
   – Identify the free function by checking the callee’s name.  
   – Retrieve the memory region corresponding to the pointer argument that is being freed.  
   – Check TaintedMemMap to see whether the region is marked as devm_ allocated.  
   – If it is flagged (true), report a bug indicating a potential double free of a memory region that is managed by devm_*.

c. checkBind (for pointer alias tracking – optional but recommended)  
   – In the checkBind callback, inspect assignments where a pointer value is bound to another variable.  
   – When such a binding is detected, update the PtrAliasMap to record that both pointers are aliases.  
   – This ensures that if one alias is marked in TaintedMemMap, the other is also considered tainted when later passed to a free routine.

------------------------------------------------
3. Bug Reporting

• In checkPreCall, when a devm_* allocated memory is being freed manually, create a non-fatal error node.  
• Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create a bug report with a succinct description, e.g., "Double free: devm_* allocated memory should not be freed manually".

------------------------------------------------
4. Detailed Implementation Steps

Step 1: In your checker initialization, register TaintedMemMap:
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(TaintedMemMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
  [Optionally also register PtrAliasMap.]

Step 2: In checkPostCall:
  – Verify the callee’s name is "devm_kcalloc".  
  – If so, get the return value expression and extract its MemRegion.  
  – Update the program state in TaintedMemMap to mark the region as tainted.

Step 3: In checkPreCall:
  – Check if the invoked function is "pinctrl_utils_free_map".  
  – Retrieve the first argument’s memory region.  
  – Lookup the region (or its alias from PtrAliasMap) in TaintedMemMap.  
  – If the mapping indicates that the region was allocated via devm_* (flag is true), generate a bug report indicating a potential double free.

Step 4: In checkBind (optional):
  – When pointers are propagated through assignments, update the PtrAliasMap to reflect aliasing.  
  – When one pointer gets marked (e.g., via checkPostCall), propagate the tainted status using this map.

------------------------------------------------
Your final checker will essentially catch devm_kcalloc allocations and warn if such an allocation is later manually freed with pinctrl_utils_free_map (directly or indirectly via pinconf_generic_dt_free_map). The design is kept straightforward with minimal steps and leverages existing utility functions to simplify extracting source information and memory regions.
