1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a simple map (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) named TaintedPtrMap that maps const MemRegion* to a bool. This map will record memory regions allocated via device-managed functions (e.g. devm_kcalloc). The key will be the memory region and the value will be true if it is allocated with devm_* functions.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use checkPostCall to intercept allocation calls.
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept calls that free memory.
   • Optionally (if aliasing is a common pattern) use checkBind with a PtrAliasMap to track pointer aliasing, but the simplest solution is tracking the allocation region directly through its return value.

3. Implement checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, examine the CallEvent:
     - If the callee name is "devm_kcalloc" (or any other devm_* allocation function that should not be manually freed), then retrieve the call’s return value.
     - Use the provided utility function getMemRegionFromExpr() on the return expression to extract its MemRegion.
     - Update the TaintedPtrMap by mapping this region to true. This marks the pointer as allocated by devm_* (managed) functions.

4. Implement checkPreCall:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to free-like functions:
     - Check if the callee name is "pinctrl_utils_free_map" (or any similar function that manually frees memory).
     - Extract the pointer argument from the call. Use getMemRegionFromExpr() on the respective expression argument.
     - Query the TaintedPtrMap for this MemRegion.
     - If found and marked true, this indicates that the memory being freed was allocated via devm_* and is subject to double free; then report a bug using a short and clear message (e.g., “Double free of devm_* allocated memory.”). Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport to create and emit the bug report.

5. (Optional) Use checkBind for Pointer Aliasing:
   • Although not mandatory, if pointer aliasing is common you can also:
     - REGISTER a PtrAliasMap (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) mapping const MemRegion* to its alias.
     - In checkBind, record aliasing relationships so that when one pointer is used in a free call, its aliases stored in the program state can also be recognized as coming from a devm_* allocation.
   • When marking a pointer as tainted in checkPostCall, update all its aliases accordingly.

This streamlined plan uses two main callbacks (checkPostCall for allocations and checkPreCall for deallocations), along with a simple taint map, to detect the pattern where device-managed memory is manually freed, potentially resulting in a double free.
