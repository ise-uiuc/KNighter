Plan for Checker: Detecting Double-Free of Memory Allocated with devm_* Functions

1. Program State Customization:
   • REGISTER a program state map to track device-managed allocations:
       – Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DevmAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
         to record that a given memory region was allocated using a devm_* routine.
   • (Optionally) REGISTER another map for pointer aliasing (PtrAliasMap) if you want
       to track pointer copies. This allows alias updates when a checked pointer is bound
       to another variable.

2. Callback: checkPostCall (for Memory Allocation)
   • In checkPostCall, intercept call events.
   • Detect calls to devm_kcalloc (or other devm_* allocations as needed) by checking the
       callee name.
   • When a call to a devm_* allocator is identified:
       – Retrieve the return value’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr.
       – Mark the corresponding region in DevmAllocMap as true.
   • (If using pointer aliasing) Use checkBind to propagate the region’s property to aliases.
   • This step marks any memory region allocated via devm_* as managed, which should not be freed manually.

3. Callback: checkPreCall (for Manual Freeing)
   • In checkPreCall, intercept call events to deallocation functions (specifically calls to
       pinctrl_utils_free_map or the wrapper function pinconf_generic_dt_free_map that eventually
       calls it).
   • For each detected free call:
       – Extract the pointer argument that is to be freed.
       – Retrieve its corresponding MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
       – Look up this region in DevmAllocMap.
   • If the region is found with a device-managed flag (true), then report an error indicating
       that freeing memory allocated by a devm_* function may cause a double free.
   • Use a simple and clear bug report message (e.g., "Double free of devm_* allocated memory")
       and generate a bug report via std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

4. Pointer Aliasing (Optional but Recommended)
   • In checkBind, track when a pointer is assigned to another pointer:
       – When a pointer from DevmAllocMap gets bound to another variable, record the alias in
         PtrAliasMap using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE.
       – When verifying the free call, consult PtrAliasMap to check if any alias marked as device‐managed
         is being manually freed.
   • This ensures that even if the pointer gets copied, manual free detection considers all aliases.

Summary of Steps:
   1. Customize program state with DevmAllocMap (and optionally PtrAliasMap).
   2. In checkPostCall, detect devm_kcalloc calls and mark the returned region as deviceManaged.
   3. In checkPreCall, detect calls to pinctrl_utils_free_map (or related free functions). If the argument’s
       region is marked as device-managed, report a potential double free.
   4. (Optional) Use checkBind to update aliasing information so that pointer copies retain their device-managed tag.

This concise plan provides a clear and concrete guideline to implement the checker following the correct steps and callback functions.
