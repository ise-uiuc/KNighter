Plan:
1. Register Program State Maps:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DevmAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will mark memory regions allocated via devm_* functions.
   • (Optionally) REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
     – This map will track pointer alias relationships so that if one pointer is tainted, its aliases can also be flagged.

2. Allocation Tracking (checkPostCall):
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to allocation functions.
   • If the called function is devm_kcalloc (or any devm_* function that should not be manually freed), then:
       – Retrieve the return expression’s MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
       – Update DevmAllocMap to set the region’s flag true (indicating automatic management).
   • Optionally, in checkBind, when a pointer is assigned (aliasing), update PtrAliasMap to record that the alias points to the same memory region.

3. Freeing Function Check (checkPreCall):
   • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to free functions.
   • Identify calls to pinctrl_utils_free_map, which is a manual deallocation function.
   • Extract the pointer argument’s MemRegion from the call.
   • Look up the pointer (or its alias if using PtrAliasMap) in DevmAllocMap. If it exists and is marked true (tainted by devm_* allocation), then:
       – Report an error with the message "Double free of devm_alloc memory".
       – Create an error node and bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport).

4. Implementation Details for Callbacks:
   • checkPostCall:
       – Check that the callee’s name exactly matches "devm_kcalloc".
       – Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the return expression.
       – If the region is valid, set (region, true) in DevmAllocMap.
   • checkPreCall:
       – Check if the callee’s name equals "pinctrl_utils_free_map".
       – Retrieve the first argument of the call as an Expr, then derive its MemRegion.
       – If using PtrAliasMap, resolve any aliasing to the canonical region.
       – If the region exists in DevmAllocMap and is marked tainted, report a bug.
   • checkBind (optional for alias tracking):
       – When a pointer gets bound to another (e.g. p2 = p1), record if p1’s region is in DevmAllocMap.
       – Update PtrAliasMap so that p2 also maps to the same region as p1.

Following these concise yet concrete steps will permit the checker to detect the pattern of double-free due to improper use of device-managed allocation functions with manual deallocation.
