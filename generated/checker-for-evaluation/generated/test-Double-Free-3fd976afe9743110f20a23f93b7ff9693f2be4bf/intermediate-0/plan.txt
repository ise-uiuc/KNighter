1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER a program state map to track pointers allocated using devm_* functions. For example, use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DevmAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool), where the bool value signifies that the memory is auto-managed (tainted by devm_*).
   • Optionally, register a PtrAliasMap to track pointer aliasing if you want to handle cases where an allocated pointer is stored to another variable. However, you can keep it simple if aliasing is uncommon for this pattern.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   a. In checkPostCall:
      – Intercept function calls and check if the callee name starts with "devm_". You can use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare its name with a list of known functions (e.g., devm_kcalloc, devm_kmalloc, etc.).
      – If the call matches, obtain the return expression’s MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      – Update the DevmAllocMap in the program state: mark the pointer’s region with a flag (true) indicating that it was allocated via a device-managed function.
   
   b. In checkPreCall:
      – Intercept calls to freeing functions such as "pinctrl_utils_free_map" (or indirectly, the function that invokes it, like pinconf_generic_dt_free_map).
      – Retrieve the argument that represents the pointer to be freed and get its associated MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr or similar).
      – Query the DevmAllocMap using this region. If the region is marked as device-managed (tainted), then a manual free is being attempted on auto-managed memory.
      – In this case, generate a bug report by creating a non-fatal error node and a PathSensitiveBugReport with a clear, short message such as “Double free: device-managed memory freed manually”.
   
   c. (Optional) In checkBind:
      – If pointer aliasing must be tracked, intercept pointer bindings.
      – When a pointer allocated via a devm_* function is assigned to another variable, update the PtrAliasMap so that later checks consider the alias as well. Ensure that when one pointer is flagged, all its aliases in the PtrAliasMap are also flagged.
      – This step helps prevent false negatives when the allocated pointer is passed around.

3. Implementation Details for Each Callback:
   • checkPostCall: For each call, retrieve the callee name. If it matches one in the devm_* allocation set, get the returned MemRegion and update DevmAllocMap in the current state to associate that region with “true”.
   • checkPreCall: When a free-like function is called, obtain the pointer argument’s MemRegion. Lookup the region in DevmAllocMap; if found, trigger a report through the bug reporting API (e.g., using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) with a concise “Double free of device-managed memory” message.
   • (Optional) checkBind: When a pointer is copied, record the alias information in the PtrAliasMap so that subsequent checks on any alias correctly reflect the devm_* taint.

This simple, straightforward approach leverages minimal callbacks (primarily checkPostCall for allocation detection and checkPreCall for freeing detection) and program state maps. It finalizes the checker for detecting the double free bug pattern as posed by the patch.
