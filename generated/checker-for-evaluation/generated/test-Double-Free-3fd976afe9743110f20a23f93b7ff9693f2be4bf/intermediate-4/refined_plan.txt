Your plan here

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DeviceManagedAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will track memory regions allocated via devm_kcalloc.
     – The bool value can be “true” if the allocation originated from a devm_* call.
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
     – Although not strictly required for this checker, it can be used to track pointer aliasing so that if an alias is passed later to a free function, you can still identify the original region.

2. Choose callback functions and implement the steps:

   A. Track Automatic (devm_*) Memory Allocations (checkPostCall):
      • In the checkPostCall callback, inspect function call events.
      • Check if the callee is “devm_kcalloc” by comparing the CallEvent’s callee identifier.
      • If it is a devm_* allocation:
         - Retrieve the returned value’s associated MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
         - Update DeviceManagedAllocMap by mapping this MemRegion to true.
         - (Optionally, record any relevant alias information in PtrAliasMap if you need to track pointer propagation.)

   B. Detect Manual Freeing of Auto-managed Memory (checkPreCall):
      • In the checkPreCall callback, intercept calls to functions that perform manual deallocation.
      • Identify the free call by checking if the callee’s name equals “pinctrl_utils_free_map” (or related free functions such as “pinconf_generic_dt_free_map” that indirectly free the memory).
      • Extract the pointer argument that is to be freed from the CallEvent.
      • Retrieve the corresponding MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and (if needed) follow any alias links from PtrAliasMap.
      • Consult DeviceManagedAllocMap: if the region is marked as allocated via devm_kcalloc, then a double free is being attempted.
      • Issue a bug report—a clear, short message such as “Double free of device-managed allocation” using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

   C. (Optional) Track Pointer Bindings (checkBind):
      • In checkBind, monitor assignments where a pointer gets bound to another.
      • If a pointer allocated via devm_kcalloc is assigned to another pointer, record the alias in PtrAliasMap.
      • This ensures that if the freeing function receives an alias rather than the original pointer, you can still determine the origin of the allocation.
      
3. Summary of Callback Implementations:
   • In checkPostCall:
      - Detect calls to devm_kcalloc.
      - Mark the returned MemRegion in DeviceManagedAllocMap.
   • In checkPreCall:
      - Intercept calls to pinctrl_utils_free_map (and its wrappers).
      - Retrieve the pointer’s MemRegion; check if it exists in DeviceManagedAllocMap.
      - If so, report a bug.
   • In checkBind (if alias tracking is desired):
      - Record pointer-to-pointer bindings via the PtrAliasMap so that any alias forwarded to the free-call is recognized.

By following this plan, you are using a minimal number of steps and callbacks to achieve the goal of detecting a double free caused by mixing an auto-managed devm_* allocation with explicit manual free calls.
