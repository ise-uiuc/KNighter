1. Customize Program States:
   • Register a map “TaintedMemMap” with program state to track memory regions allocated by device-managed (devm_*) functions. For example:
     • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(TaintedMemMap, const MemRegion *, bool)
   • Optionally, register a “PtrAliasMap” with program state to propagate the taint via pointer assignments using checkBind:
     • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion *, const MemRegion *)

2. Identify Device-Managed Allocations (checkPostCall):
   • In checkPostCall, intercept call events.
   • Check if the callee’s name starts with “devm_” (or exactly equals “devm_kcalloc”, “devm_kmalloc”, etc.) using the call’s identifier.
   • If matched, retrieve the memory region corresponding to the return value.
   • Update the TaintedMemMap to mark this region as tainted (e.g., true).
   • (Optionally, record a pointer alias in PtrAliasMap to handle future assignments.)

3. Propagate Pointer Aliasing (checkBind):
   • In checkBind, when a pointer is being assigned to another pointer, check if the source pointer’s memory region is marked as tainted in TaintedMemMap.
   • If tainted, update the PtrAliasMap so that the destination pointer also gets associated with the same tainted region.
   • This ensures that even if the pointer is copied, the taint remains connected.

4. Detect Manual Freeing (checkPreCall):
   • In checkPreCall, intercept function call events for manual freeing routines.
   • Specifically, check if the callee is a function known to perform a manual free on the allocated resource (e.g., pinctrl_utils_free_map or dt_free_map).
   • Retrieve the pointer argument that is being freed.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr or similar to get the base memory region for that pointer.
   • Check TaintedMemMap (and follow aliasing using PtrAliasMap if necessary) to see if the region was allocated by a devm_* function.
   • If the region is marked as tainted, report a potential double free bug with a short, clear error message like “Double free of devm_* allocated memory”.

5. Reporting the Bug:
   • When a tainted memory region is detected being manually freed, generate a bug report using a non-fatal error node.
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) and provide a concise message.
   • Emit the bug report using the checker context.

This concise plan—with clearly defined program state registration and callbacks (checkPostCall, checkBind, checkPreCall)—should allow you to write a correct checker for detecting double free errors resulting from device-managed allocations being manually freed.
