1. Decide if customization of program states is necessary:
   • For this checker, no complex pointer or taint tracking is needed. We do not need any program state maps or alias tracking since the bug pattern is detected directly by identifying a call to strcpy on a fixed-size destination buffer.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept every call event.

3. Implementing the checkPreCall callback:
   • In checkPreCall, first determine if the call is to the function "strcpy". Use the CallEvent’s callee identifier (e.g., Call.getCalleeIdentifier()) and compare it with the string "strcpy".
   • If the call is to strcpy, extract the first argument (the destination buffer expression) from the call.
   • Apply the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr on the destination expression to check whether it is a fixed-size array.
   • If getArraySizeFromExpr returns true (meaning the destination is a constant-size array), this indicates that an unbounded string copy is being attempted on a fixed-size buffer.
   • At this point, generate a bug report:
       – Generate a non-fatal error node.
       – Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create a bug report with a short, clear message such as "Unbounded strcpy on fixed-size buffer may overflow".
       – Emit the report as required.

4. Summary:
   • No additional state tracking or alias analysis is needed.
   • The entire bug pattern detection is completed in checkPreCall by examining the function name and processing the destination argument.
   • The utility function getArraySizeFromExpr is the key for determining if the destination is a fixed-rate buffer.

This concise plan should allow you to write a checker that correctly detects the usage of strcpy on fixed-size buffers and reports a potential buffer overflow bug.
