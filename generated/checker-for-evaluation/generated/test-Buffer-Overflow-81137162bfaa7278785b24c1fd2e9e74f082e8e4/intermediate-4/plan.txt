Your plan here

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • No need to customize program state maps (like PtrAliasMap) since this checker only needs to analyze the call arguments of strcpy directly without tracking pointer aliasing or state changes.

2. Choose the callback functions:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept calls to strcpy.
   • Optionally, use checkBind if you want to better resolve the destination variable, but this is not essential.

3. Detailed implementation steps within checkPreCall:
   a. In checkPreCall, examine every function call. Use the CallEvent API to get the callee’s identifier.
      • If the callee’s name equals "strcpy", then continue analysis.
   
   b. Retrieve the two arguments of the strcpy call:
      • The first argument is the destination buffer.
      • The second argument is the source string.
   
   c. For the destination buffer:
      • Use the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr to check if the destination is a fixed-size array.
      • If getArraySizeFromExpr returns true and gives a valid array size, then the destination is a candidate for overflow.
   
   d. Optionally, for the source string:
      • If the source argument is a string literal, use getStringSize to retrieve its size.
      • If getStringSize succeeds and the string length is equal to or larger than the destination's fixed size, this strengthens the evidence of potential overflow.
   
   e. Report the potential bug:
      • If the unsafe use of strcpy is confirmed (i.e. the destination is a fixed-size buffer and there is a risk of overflow), then generate a bug report.
      • Use a simple bug report such as a BasicBugReport with a message like "Unsafe strcpy usage may overflow fixed-size buffer" to warn the user.
      • Create the bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> if you wish to include more path-sensitive information).

4. Additional notes:
   • Ensure that the checker does not issue a false positive if the destination is not statically known to be a fixed-size buffer.
   • Follow the simplicity goal and use just checkPreCall along with the provided utility functions for comparing array sizes and string sizes.
   • The report message should be short and clear, e.g., "Unsafe strcpy may lead to buffer overflow."

Following these steps will help you implement a simple—but effective—checker to detect unsafe usage of strcpy that might overflow a fixed-size buffer.
