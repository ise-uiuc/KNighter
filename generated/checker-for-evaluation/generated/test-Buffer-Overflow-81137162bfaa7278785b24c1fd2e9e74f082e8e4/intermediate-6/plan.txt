Your plan here

1. Decide on Program States:
   • No custom program state maps are needed for this checker since the bug can be detected on the call site without tracking state over time.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept function call events.

3. Implement checkPreCall Callback:
   • In checkPreCall, verify whether the callee identifier is "strcpy".
   • If a strcpy call is found, extract its first argument (the destination buffer expression).
   • Use the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr to attempt to retrieve the fixed array size of the destination. This detects that the destination is a fixed-size buffer (e.g. the fixed char[] field).
   • Optionally, if the source argument is a string literal, use getStringSize on it to get its length. Compare its size with the destination array size to decide if the copy might overflow.
   • If the destination is fixed-size and there is a potential overflow risk (or simply the unchecked call is detected), report a bug.

4. Report the Bug:
   • Call generateNonFatalErrorNode to mark the error location.
   • Create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short message such as "Unchecked string copy on a fixed-size buffer may cause buffer overflow".
   • Emit the bug report via the BugReporter.

5. Summary:
   • There is no need for alias tracking or other program state maps.
   • All checking is performed in checkPreCall by comparing the callee’s name, inspecting the destination’s declaration with getArraySizeFromExpr, optionally comparing the source literal size with getStringSize, and finally reporting an error with a concise message.

Follow these steps in your implementation to correctly detect the bug pattern of using strcpy with a fixed-size destination buffer without bounds checking.
