Your plan can be structured in a few simple steps without introducing complex program states. Here's the concrete plan:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program State Customizations:
   • No custom program state maps (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) are necessary for this bug pattern since the issue is due to the misuse of strcpy on a fixed-size buffer.
   • No pointer aliasing tracking is needed.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   • Use checkPreCall because you want to intercept calls to strcpy before they execute.
   
3. Implement the Callback Function (checkPreCall):
   • In checkPreCall, first check if the callee’s identifier equals "strcpy". You can use the call event’s getCalleeIdentifier() to perform this check.
   • If the function is not "strcpy", do nothing.
   
4. Retrieve and Analyze the Call Arguments:
   • Get the destination argument (the first argument) from the Call object.
   • Use the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr to see if the destination expression corresponds to a fixed-size array.
     – If getArraySizeFromExpr returns true, you know the destination buffer has a fixed capacity.
   • Since strcpy does not perform any bounds checking and you are copying from a potentially unbounded source to a fixed-destination,
     – This is exactly the dangerous pattern that could lead to a buffer overflow.
   
5. Report the Bug:
   • If the destination buffer is fixed-size (as determined by getArraySizeFromExpr) and strcpy is used,
     – Use a bug report generation function (e.g. std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) to emit a warning.
   • Keep the message short and clear – for example: "Unbounded strcpy used on fixed-size buffer; potential buffer overflow."
   
------------------------------------------------------------
This plan is simple and minimal:

• Use checkPreCall to intercept strcpy calls.
• Retrieve and analyze the destination argument using getArraySizeFromExpr.
• Report a bug if a fixed-size buffer is used with strcpy (unbounded copy).

Following these concrete steps ensures your checker is easy to write while correctly detecting the unbounded string copy bug pattern.
