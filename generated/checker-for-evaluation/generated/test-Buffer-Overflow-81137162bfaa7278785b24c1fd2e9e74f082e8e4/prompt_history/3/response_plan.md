Your plan here

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No new program state maps are strictly needed for this checker since the target bug pattern can be detected by directly analyzing the call arguments.  
   • No pointer aliasing maps are needed because our focus is simply to detect a destination buffer that is a fixed-size array passed to strcpy.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use checkPreCall to intercept function calls.
   • Optionally, use checkBind if you later require alias resolution, but for this simple pattern it is not necessary.

3. Implement the checkPreCall Callback:
   • In the checkPreCall callback, first identify if the call is to strcpy by comparing the callee identifier with "strcpy". Use the provided utility function ExprHasName if needed.
   • Once a strcpy call is detected, retrieve the destination argument (i.e., the first argument).
   • Use the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr on the destination expression to determine if it is a fixed-size array. If getArraySizeFromExpr returns true, it indicates that the destination buffer is size-limited.
   • (Optional) To further increase confidence, check if the source argument might be too long by attempting to get its length via getStringSize. If the source’s length exceeds the destination’s fixed size, this reinforces the unsafe pattern.
   • If a fixed-size destination is detected (possibly with an oversized source), generate a bug report.

4. Bug Reporting:
   • In the same callback, use a bug reporting mechanism (e.g., std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) to immediately report the bug.
   • The report message should be short and clear, for example: "Unsafe string copy into fixed-size buffer detected. Use bounds-checked copy functions (e.g., strscpy)."

This straightforward plan allows you to determine at the point of the strcpy call whether it involves copying data into a fixed-size buffer. With the provided utility functions, you can extract the necessary information from the AST and easily issue a clear diagnostic when the unsafe call is detected.
