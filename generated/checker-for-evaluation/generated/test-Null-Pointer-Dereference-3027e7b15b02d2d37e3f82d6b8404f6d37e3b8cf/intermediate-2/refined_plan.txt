Your plan is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Custom Program States

• Define a program state map, for instance:  
 REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PossibleNullPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
This map will record devm_kasprintf return regions and whether they have been NULL‐checked (false means unchecked, true means checked).

• (Optionally) Define a pointer alias map to track aliasing between pointers (so that if one copy of the pointer is checked later, all aliases are updated).

----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Their Implementation

a. checkPostCall  
 • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to devm_kasprintf.  
 • Verify that the callee name is “devm_kasprintf” (use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare its name).  
 • If the call is to devm_kasprintf, retrieve the returned pointer’s memory region (using getMemRegionFromExpr).  
 • Record this region in the PossibleNullPtrMap and mark it as unchecked (i.e. set its value to false).

b. checkBind  
 • In checkBind, monitor assignments involving devm_kasprintf return values.  
 • When a pointer (the LHS) is bound to a value (the RHS) that comes from a devm_kasprintf allocation, copy the “unchecked” status from the RHS’s region to the LHS’s region in the PossibleNullPtrMap.  
 • Also update the alias map if you use one, so that all aliases have the same null-check status.

c. checkBranchCondition  
 • In checkBranchCondition, inspect the condition expression for a null-check of a pointer.  
 • Identify if the condition compares the pointer (obtained earlier from devm_kasprintf) with NULL (e.g., using idioms like “if (!ptr)”, “if (ptr == NULL)”, or “if (ptr != NULL)”).  
 • For the corresponding pointer memory region, update the PossibleNullPtrMap entry to mark it as checked (i.e., true).  
 • (If using an alias map, update the status for all tracked aliases.)

d. checkLocation  
 • In checkLocation, catch dereference events (load or store).  
 • When a pointer is dereferenced and its memory region is found in the PossibleNullPtrMap with a value of false, it indicates that the devm_kasprintf return value was used without a safety check.  
 • At this moment, generate a concise bug report (using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a message like “Unchecked devm_kasprintf return value” and emit the report.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of Steps

 1. Customize program state by creating a map (and alias map if needed) to track devm_kasprintf pointers and their null-checked status.  
 2. In checkPostCall, record the devm_kasprintf allocation as unchecked.  
 3. In checkBind, propagate the unchecked state to aliases.  
 4. In checkBranchCondition, mark the pointer as checked when a null-check is performed.  
 5. In checkLocation, detect when an unchecked pointer is dereferenced and report the bug.

----------------------------------------------------------------
This plan follows a simple, step-by-step approach that uses minimal callbacks and program state maps to detect the bug pattern.
