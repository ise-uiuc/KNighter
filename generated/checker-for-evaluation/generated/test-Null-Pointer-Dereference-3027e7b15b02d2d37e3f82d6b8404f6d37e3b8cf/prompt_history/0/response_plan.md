Your plan here

1. Customize the program state:
   • REGISTER a map (let’s call it PossibleNullPtrMap) using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PossibleNullPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool) to record the pointer (memory region) returned by devm_kasprintf() and mark whether it has been null-checked (true means checked, false means unchecked).
   • Optionally, register a PtrAliasMap with REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*) if you want to track pointer aliasing, so that if one alias is checked, its counterparts are also updated.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkPostCall to intercept function calls.
   • Use checkBranchCondition to catch conditional checks involving the pointer.
   • Use checkLocation to detect pointer dereferences.
   • Optionally, use checkBind to track pointer assignments (alias propagation) if needed.

3. Implement checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, examine the CallEvent.
   • If the callee is “devm_kasprintf”, retrieve the return value’s mem region (using getMemRegionFromExpr on the return expression).
   • Add an entry in PossibleNullPtrMap mapping this region to false (unchecked). This marks that the allocation’s return value has not yet been verified against NULL.

4. Implement checkBranchCondition:
   • In checkBranchCondition, analyze the condition expression.
   • If the expression compares the pointer from a devm_kasprintf call against NULL (for instance, using “if (!ptr)” or “if (ptr == NULL)”), extract the MemRegion from the expression (with getMemRegionFromExpr).
   • If the region exists in PossibleNullPtrMap, update its value to true (i.e., mark it as null-checked) using your internal helper (e.g., setChecked). Propagate the check to aliases via the PtrAliasMap if present.

5. Implement checkLocation:
   • In checkLocation, intercept any pointer dereference (both load and store).
   • Retrieve the pointer’s MemRegion from the expression.
   • Check in the program state’s PossibleNullPtrMap: if the region is mapped and its flag is false (i.e., not null-checked), then generate a bug report.
   • Report a short error message such as “Unchecked devm_kasprintf() return may be NULL.”

6. (Optional) Implement checkBind:
   • In checkBind, when a pointer is assigned to another (e.g., p2 = p1), retrieve the mem region from both sides.
   • In the program state’s PtrAliasMap, record the aliasing relationship so that a null check on one pointer can propagate to its aliases.
   • When marking a pointer as checked in checkBranchCondition, update all its aliases accordingly.

Following these concrete steps, you can implement a straightforward checker that flags cases where devm_kasprintf()’s return pointer is used without properly checking for a NULL result before usage.
