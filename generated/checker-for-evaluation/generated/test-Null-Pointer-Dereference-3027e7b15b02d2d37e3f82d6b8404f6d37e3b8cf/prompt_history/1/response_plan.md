Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide if custom program states are needed:  
   • Use a program state map, for example, REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PossibleNullPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool), to track the devm_kasprintf return value. The boolean will indicate whether the pointer has been checked for NULL (true means checked, false means unchecked).  
   • Also register a PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) for pointer aliasing if the allocated pointer is later assigned to another variable.

2. Choose and implement callback functions:

   • In checkPostCall:  
     – Intercept calls to devm_kasprintf by checking the callee’s name.  
     – If the call is from devm_kasprintf, extract the return value’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr.  
     – Update the PossibleNullPtrMap with this region and mark it as unchecked (false).  

   • In checkBranchCondition:  
     – Examine branch-condition expressions. If the condition appears to be a check on the devm_kasprintf result (for example, testing if the pointer is NULL or non-NULL), then determine the memory region associated with that pointer.  
     – When such a condition is detected, mark that region (and its aliases) as checked (true) in the PossibleNullPtrMap.  

   • In checkBind:  
     – Track assignments where the pointer (obtained from devm_kasprintf) is stored into another variable.  
     – Update the PtrAliasMap accordingly so that if one alias is marked as checked later, all related regions get updated.

   • In checkLocation:  
     – In any statement that dereferences a pointer, get the location’s memory region.  
     – If the region (or one of its aliases, via PtrAliasMap) is present in the PossibleNullPtrMap with a false value (i.e. still unchecked), then report a bug.  
     – Use a short, clear report message such as “Unchecked devm_kasprintf return used” via generateNonFatalErrorNode or a BasicBugReport.

3. Bug Reporting:  
   – Keep the report message short.  
   – Create the report when a dereference (in checkLocation) is detected on an unchecked region, ensuring that it is nonfatal.

Following these concrete steps will allow you to detect the failure to check devm_kasprintf()’s return for NULL and warn about the risk of a potential null pointer dereference.
