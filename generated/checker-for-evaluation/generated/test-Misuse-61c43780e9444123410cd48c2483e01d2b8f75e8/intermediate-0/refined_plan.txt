Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No customized program state is needed because the check only involves constant value analysis in a specific function call.

2. Choose Callback Function:
   • Use checkPreCall() to intercept every call as it occurs.

3. Implementation Details for checkPreCall:
   • First, check if the callee’s name is "devlink_nl_port_fill" by using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and comparing its name as a string.
   • Access the third argument (index 2) from the call’s argument list. This argument represents the command constant.
   • Use a utility, such as obtaining the macro string via getNameAsString() on the third argument’s expression, to retrieve its literal text.
   • Compare the extracted string with "DEVLINK_CMD_NEW". If it matches, this indicates the use of the wrong command constant.
   • Upon detection, issue a short, clear bug report. Use a function like std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) along with generateNonFatalErrorNode to flag the issue with the message "Incorrect command constant: DEVLINK_CMD_NEW used instead of DEVLINK_CMD_PORT_NEW".

4. Wrap-up:
   • If the check passes (i.e., the constant is not "DEVLINK_CMD_NEW"), do nothing and allow the analysis to continue.
   • No additional pointer or alias tracking is required for this bug pattern.

Following these concrete, step-by-step guidelines will help you implement the checker correctly.
