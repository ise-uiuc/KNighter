1. Customize Program State:
   • Use a program state map (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(NetdevAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) to record net devices allocated by alloc_etherdev(). The key is the mem region for the allocated net device and the boolean value indicates whether it has been freed (false initially, set to true when free_netdev() is called).

2. Callback: checkPostCall for Memory Allocation:
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to alloc_etherdev().
   • Extract the return value (the allocated netdev) and its corresponding memory region.
   • Insert an entry into NetdevAllocMap, marking the net device as “not freed” (false).

3. Callback: checkPostCall for Resource Deallocation:
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to free_netdev().
   • Extract the argument (the netdev pointer) and find its memory region.
   • Update the NetdevAllocMap to mark that region as freed (true). Use any pointer analysis available (and optionally check aliases using PtrAliasMap if needed).

4. Callback: checkPostCall for the Critical Function:
   • Also in checkPostCall, intercept calls to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register().
   • When this function returns an error (non-zero), retrieve the associated netdev pointer whose resource leak is in question.
   • Using the program state (NetdevAllocMap), check if the netdev’s region is still marked as “not freed.”
   • If the netdev is not freed, report a bug with a short message such as "Net device not freed on error path".

5. Reporting the Bug:
   • Use a bug reporting utility (e.g., std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) to emit a warning/node.
   • The message should be short and clear.

By following these concrete steps—tracking allocation in alloc_etherdev, marking the region as freed with free_netdev, then verifying that rvu_rep_devlink_port_register’s error branch frees the resource—you can implement a CSA checker to detect this resource leak in a straightforward and minimalistic manner.
