Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State

• REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocatedNetdevMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  – This map is used to record network device memory (ndev) that has been allocated (true) but not yet freed.  
  – When an allocation is made (via alloc_etherdev), record the associated memory region in this map.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. checkPostCall  
  – Intercept calls that return a network device pointer and calls that free it.  
  – For alloc_etherdev:  
    • When alloc_etherdev is called, obtain its return value’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr.  
    • Add this region to AllocatedNetdevMap with the flag set to true.  
  – For free_netdev:  
    • When free_netdev is called in checkPostCall, extract the network device pointer’s region.  
    • Update the state in AllocatedNetdevMap (mark as false or remove the entry) to indicate that the corresponding allocation has been freed.

B. checkPostCall (for rvu_rep_devlink_port_register)  
  – Intercept the call to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register.  
  – If it returns an error (non-zero value), check the current state:  
    • Look up the network device (ndev) associated with this error path by retrieving its memory region (this might be available via a local variable binding tracked by checkBind if necessary).  
    • If the region from ndev is still marked as allocated in AllocatedNetdevMap (i.e. has not been freed), then the netdev is leaked on error.  
  – Report the bug using a short and clear message such as “Potential memory leak: netdev not freed on error path.”

C. checkBind  
  – Use checkBind to track aliasing if the allocated network device pointer is assigned to another variable.  
  – Update the AllocatedNetdevMap for any alias that is bound to the original ndev pointer.  
  – This ensures that if the pointer is freed via an alias, the record is updated accordingly.

D. checkEndFunction  
  – At the end of the function analysis (e.g. rvu_rep_create), inspect the AllocatedNetdevMap from the program state.  
  – If any network device regions remain marked as allocated (true), generate a bug report to flag the leak (even if it might be on a specific error path).

--------------------------------------------------
3. Detailed Implementation Steps

Step 1: Record Allocation
  • In checkPostCall, detect a call to alloc_etherdev.  
  • Extract the return value’s symbolic memory region via getMemRegionFromExpr before any binding modification.  
  • Insert the region into AllocatedNetdevMap with a flag ‘true’ indicating it has not been freed.

Step 2: Record Deallocation
  • In checkPostCall, detect a call to free_netdev.  
  • Extract the argument’s memory region from the call.  
  • Update the state: remove this region or mark it as false in AllocatedNetdevMap.

Step 3: Issue on Error Path from Device Registration
  • In checkPostCall, intercept the call to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register.  
  • If the call returns an error, retrieve the associated ndev region (recorded earlier from alloc_etherdev).  
  • Check AllocatedNetdevMap for that region.  
  • If the region is still marked as allocated (true), then the network device has not been freed on the error path.  
  • Immediately report this condition with a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) and a message like “Memory leak: netdev not freed after rvu_rep_devlink_port_register failure.”

Step 4: Handle Aliasing via checkBind
  • In checkBind, when a network device pointer is bound to another, update the AllocatedNetdevMap to reflect the aliasing relationship (e.g. using a PtrAliasMap, if needed, to ensure that freeing via one alias will update the state for all aliases).
  • When one alias is freed, update all related mappings so that the leak flag is cleared.

Step 5: Final Check in checkEndFunction
  • As a backup check, in checkEndFunction, examine the overall program state for any network device regions that are still marked as allocated.
  • For any leftover entry, generate a bug report to point out a potential leak that was not addressed on the error path.

--------------------------------------------------

Your plan uses the simplest steps:
1. Customize a program state map to track allocation/freeing.
2. Use checkPostCall to record both allocation (alloc_etherdev) and deallocation (free_netdev).
3. Check the error path for rvu_rep_devlink_port_register failure and report a leak if free_netdev was not called.
4. Employ checkBind for pointer alias tracking.
5. Optionally, finalize your detection in checkEndFunction.

With this plan, you have a clear, step-by-step method to implement a checker that detects a memory leak on an error exit path where free_netdev() is omitted.
