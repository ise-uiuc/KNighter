1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a map in the program state to track net_device pointers allocated by alloc_etherdev. For example, use
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocDeviceMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     where each key is the MemRegion for a net_device and the value “true/false” indicates whether free_netdev has been called.

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   • In checkPostCall (for function calls):
     – When alloc_etherdev is called:
       • Identify the call by matching its callee name.
       • If the call returns a non-null pointer, use getMemRegionFromExpr() on the return value to get its MemRegion.
       • Record this region in AllocDeviceMap with the flag set to false (indicating that free_netdev has not yet been executed).
     – When free_netdev is called:
       • Detect calls to free_netdev.
       • Extract its pointer argument (using the provided utilities such as getMemRegionFromExpr).
       • Update AllocDeviceMap, marking the corresponding net_device region as freed (or remove it from the map).

   • In checkPostCall (for rvu_rep_devlink_port_register):
     – Detect calls to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register.
     – Evaluate the integer return value (using EvaluateExprToInt or similar). If the call returns an error (nonzero), then proceed.
     – Retrieve (or infer via parent/child AST navigation using findSpecificTypeInParents or findSpecificTypeInChildren) the net_device pointer associated with this call. (Typically this pointer should be available as an argument member of the object related to the error path.)
     – Use getMemRegionFromExpr to get its MemRegion.
     – Look up this region in AllocDeviceMap. If the net_device is still marked as not freed (flag is false), then the error branch is missing a free_netdev call.
     – Report a bug with a short, clear message (for example: “Memory leak: net_device not freed on error path”) using generateNonFatalErrorNode and a PathSensitiveBugReport.

3. Summary:
   – The checker will use program state to track the allocation (via alloc_etherdev) and cleanup (via free_netdev) of net_device pointers.
   – When a call to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register fails, the checker will cross-check the associated net_device pointer in AllocDeviceMap.
   – If the net_device is not freed before exiting, the checker emits a bug report indicating a potential memory leak.
   
This plan uses minimal steps while leveraging the provided utility functions and callbacks to efficiently track resource management and detect the error pattern.
