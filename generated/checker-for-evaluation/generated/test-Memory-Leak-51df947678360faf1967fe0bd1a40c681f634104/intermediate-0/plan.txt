1. Determine if additional program states are needed:  
   • In this checker no custom program state mapping is required since we can rely on AST traversal to find whether a cleanup call exists in the error branch.  
   • Therefore, no REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE or similar is needed.

2. Choose the callback function:  
   • Use checkPostCall to intercept the call to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register.  
   • Also, use helper utilities (findSpecificTypeInParents and findSpecificTypeInChildren) to analyze the surrounding AST structure of the call.

3. Steps in checkPostCall:  
   • Intercept the call event; if the callee’s name is "rvu_rep_devlink_port_register", then process this event.  
   • Examine the return value from this call. Assume that any non-zero error indicates a failure and triggers the error branch.  
   • Traverse upward in the AST using findSpecificTypeInParents to locate the enclosing IfStmt or conditional block where the return value is checked.  
   • Within the then-branch of that conditional statement, traverse downward (with findSpecificTypeInChildren) to search for a call to free_netdev.  
     - Optionally, check that the argument of the free_netdev call corresponds to the net_device allocated earlier (e.g. by a DeclRefExpr relating to ndev).  
   • If no free_netdev call is found in the error branch, then generate a bug report using a short message (for example: "Resource leak: netdev not freed on error path").

4. Bug Reporting:  
   • Use generateNonFatalErrorNode (or similar) and create a bug report (e.g. via std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a concise message.  
   • Report the error node once the checker identifies that, on failure of rvu_rep_devlink_port_register, free_netdev is missing.

5. Summary of Implementation:  
   • In checkPostCall, check if Call.getCalleeIdentifier() matches "rvu_rep_devlink_port_register".  
   • Verify that the call returns an error (non-zero exit).  
   • Walk up the AST via findSpecificTypeInParents to identify the if-statement comparing the error code, then in the then block use findSpecificTypeInChildren to look for free_netdev.  
   • If free_netdev is absent, report the potential memory leak issue.

Following this plan will let you implement a concise checker that detects the failure to release memory (via free_netdev) when rvu_rep_devlink_port_register fails, thereby exposing the resource leak bug pattern.
