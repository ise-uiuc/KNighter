1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a program state map using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to track allocated net_device resources. For example, define AllocatedNetdevMap mapping const MemRegion* to bool (true for allocated and not yet freed).

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • In checkPostCall:
  – Detect calls to alloc_etherdev: When alloc_etherdev returns a pointer, use getMemRegionFromExpr to extract its region and mark it as allocated (true) in AllocatedNetdevMap.
  – Detect calls to free_netdev: When free_netdev is called, retrieve the net_device pointer (or its region) from the call arguments and update AllocatedNetdevMap by marking that region as freed (set to false or remove it).

   • In checkEndFunction:
  – At function exit (specifically for rvu_rep_create), check if the function is ending with an error return.
  – Iterate over AllocatedNetdevMap: If any net_device region still remains flagged as allocated (true), report a bug using a short message like “netdev allocated resource leak on error exit.”
  – Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to generate the report.

3. Implementation Details per Step:
   • In checkPostCall:
  - For alloc_etherdev, ensure you obtain the return value’s symbolic region and update the state.
  - For free_netdev, use the utility getMemRegionFromExpr on the pointer argument and mark the corresponding entry as freed in the state.
   • In checkEndFunction:
  - Retrieve the current state and check if the function (rvu_rep_create) is returning an error. If so, traverse your AllocatedNetdevMap.
  - For each net_device that remains allocated, generate a diagnostic message indicating failure to free the resource before exiting.
   
This concise plan leverages minimal callbacks (checkPostCall and checkEndFunction) and uses a single program state map to clearly track allocation/free events, ensuring that if an error path is taken without freeing the allocated net_device, the checker will emit a clear bug report.
