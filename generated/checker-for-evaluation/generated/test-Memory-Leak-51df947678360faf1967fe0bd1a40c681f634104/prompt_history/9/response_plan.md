1. Customize program states:
   • Define a program state map using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to track if a net device (ndev) has been freed. For example, create a map (e.g., FreedNetdevMap) from a MemRegion pointer (representing ndev) to a bool value (false when allocated, true when freed).  
   • (Optionally) Create a pointer alias map (PtrAliasMap) to track aliasing for ndev if you need to follow indirect references.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkPostCall to intercept function calls.
   • Use checkBranchCondition to inspect conditional statements (the “if” checking the return value).
   • Use checkBind to track aliasing information when ndev is assigned to other variables (if necessary).

3. Implementing checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, watch for calls to two functions:
     – When a call to alloc_etherdev is detected, record the returned net device (ndev) in FreedNetdevMap marked as not freed.
     – When a call to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register is detected, locate its surrounding context. Use Utility Function findSpecificTypeInParents to get the nearest IfStmt that tests the error code.
   • For the rvu_rep_devlink_port_register call, record (or extract) the pointer argument (likely accessible via rep->netdev) that designates the resource in question.
   
4. Implementing checkBranchCondition:
   • When a branch condition is encountered (through the checkBranchCondition callback), examine the condition to see if it uses the error code from rvu_rep_devlink_port_register.
   • Once you confirm that the condition “if (err)” (or similar) is checking for failure, use the known parent IfStmt to inspect the then-branch.
   • Traverse/downward the then-branch using findSpecificTypeInChildren to check if there is a call to free_netdev.
   • Within that call, use utility ExprHasName (or similar text analysis) on the argument to match the expected resource (ndev). Optionally, compare the underlying MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) with the one in your FreedNetdevMap.
  
5. Implementing checkBind (if needed):
   • In checkBind, track assignments from the result of alloc_etherdev to other variables by updating the PtrAliasMap. This ensures that if the ndev is passed indirectly, the freed status is correctly propagated.
  
6. Bug reporting:
   • If in the examined IfStmt’s then-branch no call to free_netdev (with the correct ndev argument) is detected, then generate a bug report.
   • Use a simple error message such as “Resource not freed on error path” and create the report with std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) ensuring the message is concise and clear.

This plan leverages the simplest approach by directly detecting the structure: after rvu_rep_devlink_port_register is called, an error-check (if(err)) should clean up the allocated netdev via free_netdev. If that cleanup call is missing in the branch body, then report the bug.
