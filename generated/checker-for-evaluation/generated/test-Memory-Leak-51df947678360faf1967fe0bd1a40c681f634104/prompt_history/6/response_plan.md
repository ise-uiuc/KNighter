Your plan is as follows:

──────────────────────────────
1. Customize Program States

• REGISTER a map to track allocated netdev pointers. For example, define a program state map:

  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(NetdevAllocMap, const MemRegion*, bool)

– The key is the MemRegion representing the allocated netdev.
– The value (true/false) indicates whether the resource is still “live” (true means allocated and not yet freed).

• (Optional) REGISTER a PtrAliasMap if you need to track aliasing between netdev pointers (using checkBind), so that if an alias is freed later, the original is updated as well.

──────────────────────────────
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. checkPostCall:
  • Intercept calls to allocation and deallocation functions.
   ○ For alloc_etherdev (the allocation function):
    – Confirm via the callee name.
    – Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the returned pointer.
    – Update NetdevAllocMap with an entry for that region and mark it as “allocated” (true).
   ○ For free_netdev (the deallocation function):
    – Confirm via the callee name.
    – Retrieve the pointer (first argument) using utility functions.
    – Get its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
    – Update NetdevAllocMap to mark the region as freed (set the value to false).
   • (Optional) In the same callback, if you encounter any aliasing (e.g. if an allocation is later bound to another variable), you can leverage PtrAliasMap (together with checkBind) to propagate the “freed” status.

B. checkBind:
  • (Optional) When a netdev pointer is assigned (for example, stored in a struct member), update your PtrAliasMap
  • Propagate the “freed” marker if one of the aliases is updated. This ensures that a free call on an alias is recognized.

C. checkEndFunction:
  • At function end, retrieve the current program state.
  • Iterate over the NetdevAllocMap to identify any netdev pointer still marked as “allocated” (true).
  • If such a pointer is found, create and emit a bug report indicating: “Memory leak: netdev not freed in error-handling path.”
  • Use a simple bug reporting mechanism (for example, using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) to display a short, clear message.

──────────────────────────────
3. Implementation Flow Summary

• In checkPostCall:
  – When a call to alloc_etherdev is detected, obtain the MemRegion from the return value and mark it as allocated.
  – When a call to free_netdev is detected, obtain the MemRegion from the pointer argument and mark the corresponding entry as freed.

• In checkEndFunction:
  – Check the program state’s NetdevAllocMap for any netdev resource still flagged as allocated.
  – If one is found, emit a concise bug report indicating that an allocated resource wasn’t freed in an error-handling path.

4. Final Notes

• The implementation relies on the utility functions such as getMemRegionFromExpr to map pointers to memory regions.
• The design is kept minimal: by only tracking allocation and free events and checking at function exit you can easily cover the error path where the allocated netdev is not deallocated.
• Use checkBind if the pointer analysis needs to track more complex aliasing, but for most simple cases (like our patch), checkPostCall and checkEndFunction should suffice.

Follow these concrete, step‐by‐step instructions so that your checker can reliably detect memory leaks caused by missing free_netdev calls in error-handling paths.
