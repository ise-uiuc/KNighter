1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocatedNetDevMap, const MemRegion*, bool): Use this map to record every net_device allocated via alloc_etherdev. The key is the memory region for the allocated net_device and the value is a flag indicating whether free_netdev() has been called (true means freed, false means not freed).

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   a. checkPostCall:
      – Intercept calls to alloc_etherdev().
         • When alloc_etherdev is called, obtain the return value’s region (e.g., using getMemRegionFromExpr) and record it in AllocatedNetDevMap as “not freed” (false).
      – Intercept calls to free_netdev().
         • When free_netdev is called, get the argument (should be a DeclRefExpr or similar pointing to the net_device). From it, obtain the MemRegion and update its flag in AllocatedNetDevMap to “freed” (true).
      – Intercept calls to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register().
         • After the call, evaluate its return value using EvaluateExprToInt. If the value indicates an error (non-zero), then:
           – Retrieve the ndev (net_device) argument that was used in the call.
           – Get its associated MemRegion.
           – Look up this region in AllocatedNetDevMap. If the region is still flagged as “not freed” (false), then report a bug.

   b. Bug Reporting:
      – In checkPostCall for rvu_rep_devlink_port_register’s error branch, if the net_device is not marked free, generate a report (using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short message like “Missing free_netdev() before error exit.”

3. Implementation Details for Each Step:
   • In checkPostCall for alloc_etherdev:
     – Check if the function callee name equals "alloc_etherdev".
     – Retrieve the returned SVal, then convert it to a MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
     – Update AllocatedNetDevMap in the current state with the region mapping to false (not freed).
   • In checkPostCall for free_netdev:
     – Check if the callee equals "free_netdev".
     – Extract the argument expression, obtain its MemRegion.
     – Update AllocatedNetDevMap for this region to true (freed).
   • In checkPostCall for rvu_rep_devlink_port_register:
     – Check if the callee equals "rvu_rep_devlink_port_register".
     – Evaluate the call’s return value. If non-zero:
         ▪ Extract the pointer (ndev) used (likely among the call arguments).
         ▪ Get the corresponding MemRegion, then look up the AllocatedNetDevMap.
         ▪ If the region is not marked as freed, report the bug.

Keep the plan as simple as possible by reusing the provided utility functions to obtain MemRegions and evaluate call return values, and update the program state consistently in checkPostCall and checkBind as needed.
