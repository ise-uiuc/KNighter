Your plan should be structured to pinpoint error paths where a dynamically allocated net_device is not freed when rvu_rep_devlink_port_register() fails. Use the following simple steps:

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
1. Decide on Program State Customization

• In this checker you do not need an elaborate program‐state map because you are not tracking alias propagation across many functions.  
• You may consider a minimal map (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AllocatedNetDevMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) if you want to track whether a net_device allocated by alloc_etherdev() has already been freed. However, the simplest approach is to just inspect the error branch immediately following the call to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register().

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
2. Choose Callback Functions

• Use checkPostCall to intercept calls to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register() because you need to verify its return value as soon as the call is made.  
• Use checkPreCall on free_netdev() if you decide to augment the analysis with state tracking of net_device deallocations.  
• Optionally use checkBind or AST-related callbacks (with findSpecificTypeInParents/Children) if you want to search for the free_netdev() invocation in the syntactic error branch.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
3. Step-by-Step Implementation in a Checker

Step 1. In checkPostCall:
  • Intercept every call.  
  • If the callee name is "rvu_rep_devlink_port_register", then use EvaluateExprToInt (if needed) on the return value to check for an error (nonzero error code).

Step 2. If an error is detected:
  • Ascend the AST using findSpecificTypeInParents to identify the enclosing IfStmt or compound statement that includes the error handling branch.
  • In the then‑branch (the branch taken when rvu_rep_devlink_port_register returns an error), inspect the statements (via findSpecificTypeInChildren) to determine whether a call to free_netdev is present.
  • Alternatively, you can search the immediately following statements where the error is handled (i.e. the branch that does the “goto exit;”) for a free_netdev call.
  • (If you opt for a state‑tracking solution, in checkPostCall for alloc_etherdev record the returned net_device pointer and, in checkPostCall for free_netdev, remove or mark it as freed. Then, when an error is reported from rvu_rep_devlink_port_register, check if the corresponding net_device is still “allocated”.)

Step 3. If the AST inspection (or program state check) shows that free_netdev is not called in the error branch:
  • Use a bug reporting function (for example, by calling C.emitReport() with a PathSensitiveBugReport or BasicBugReport) to signal that there is a “Missing free_netdev on error path” bug.

4. Concrete Implementation Details for Each Callback

• In checkPostCall:
  – Get the callee identifier from the CallEvent.
  – If the callee is "rvu_rep_devlink_port_register", evaluate its return value.
  – If the return value indicates an error (nonzero), retrieve the parent statement using findSpecificTypeInParents; for instance, look for the IfStmt that manages the error check.
  – Use findSpecificTypeInChildren on the then-branch of the IfStmt to look for a call to free_netdev. You may compare the callee names using getNameAsString() with "free_netdev".
  – If no free_netdev call is found in the error branch, generate a bug report with a concise message (e.g. "Missing free_netdev in error path").

• (Optional) In checkPostCall and checkBind:
  – For a more elaborate pointer analysis, record the net_device pointer allocated via alloc_etherdev() into a program state map.  
  – In checkPostCall for free_netdev, mark that corresponding net_device as freed.  
  – Finally, in the error reporting from rvu_rep_devlink_port_register (as above), use the state map to inspect if the pointer has been freed.

5. Bug Reporting

• Always use a short, clear message when creating a bug report—for example, "Missing free_netdev on error path"—and report it as soon as the checker determines the error branch does not free the allocated net_device.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Your overall plan is thus to intercept the call to rvu_rep_devlink_port_register in checkPostCall, evaluate its error return, inspect the corresponding error branch (via AST traversal) for a free_netdev call (or use a simple program state check), and report a bug if the net_device is not freed.
