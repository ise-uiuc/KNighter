1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER a map using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(SecuredMap, const MemRegion *, bool) that associates the memory region of the queue object with a flag indicating whether its reference (via xe_file_get) has been secured (true) or not (false).

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. Use checkBind:
      • In checkBind, intercept bindings where the return value of xe_file_get is assigned to the queue’s xef field.
      • Check if the right-hand side of the binding is a call to xe_file_get (by checking the function name in the expression using ExprHasName or similar).
      • Retrieve the memory region of the left-hand side (i.e. the queue object being modified) using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Update SecuredMap in the program state by setting the flag for that region to true.

   B. Use checkPostCall:
      • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to xa_alloc by checking if the callee name is "xa_alloc".
      • From the call event, extract the argument corresponding to the object being allocated (the queue pointer q) by analyzing the call arguments.
      • Retrieve the memory region of the queue object using getMemRegionFromExpr.
      • Look up this region in SecuredMap. If the region is not marked as secured (or is missing), issue a bug report with a concise warning message (e.g. "Handle allocated before object secured").
      • Create the bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

3. Summary of Implementation:
   • The checker uses checkBind to track if a queue’s xef field is correctly updated with the result of xe_file_get. This flags the object as secured in our SecuredMap.
   • Then, checkPostCall monitors xa_alloc to ensure that the same object has already been secured before its ID is exposed to user space.
   • If xa_alloc is called on an object that has not yet been secured, the checker emits a clear and short bug warning.

This plan provides a straightforward and minimal approach to detect the premature exposure of a handle before full object initialization.
