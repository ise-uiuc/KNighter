Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Program State Customization

• Register a map (e.g., SafeExecQueueMap) using 
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(SafeExecQueueMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
to track whether an exec_queue object has been “secured” (i.e. its reference increased via xe_file_get). The key will be the memory region of the exec_queue pointer, and the value will be true if xe_file_get was called on that object before xa_alloc is invoked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Callback Functions

A. checkPostCall
 1. For every function call, check if the callee identifier is either "xe_file_get" or "xa_alloc".

  a. If the function is "xe_file_get":
   • Retrieve the return value’s MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
   • Update the program state of SafeExecQueueMap: mark this region as safe (set to true).
   • This indicates that the reference count (or similar securing action) has been taken.

  b. If the function is "xa_alloc":
   • Extract the third argument from the call (index 2) which is the exec_queue pointer.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr on this argument to obtain its corresponding MemRegion.
   • Query the SafeExecQueueMap in the current program state. If the region is either not present or not marked safe, then it indicates that the user‐accessible identifier (ID) is being exposed before the secure reference (xe_file_get) call.
   • In that case, generate a concise bug report (e.g., using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a message such as "ID allocated before object secured").

B. (Optional) checkBind
 • Although not strictly necessary for this pattern, you may add a checkBind callback if you want to track aliasing of the exec_queue pointer. Use a PtrAliasMap (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) to record aliases. Then, when one pointer is marked safe, update all its aliases. This step is optional since the target pattern is about the ordering of calls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Summary of the Implementation Steps

Step 1: In your checker’s initialization, register a program state map SafeExecQueueMap to store whether exec_queue objects are secured.

Step 2: Implement checkPostCall:
 • When intercepting a call to “xe_file_get”, retrieve its return region with getMemRegionFromExpr and set its value to true in SafeExecQueueMap.
 • When intercepting a call to “xa_alloc”, get the third argument’s MemRegion. Look up this region in SafeExecQueueMap; if it isn’t present or is false, then immediately report a bug that the user-accessible ID is exposed before the exec_queue’s lifetime is secured.

Step 3 (Optional): In checkBind, if desired, trace aliasing of the exec_queue pointer so that if any alias later gets secured (via xe_file_get), all related locations in PtrAliasMap are updated. However, if you choose the simplest approach you can omit this if the pointer is not widely aliased.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps in the checkPostCall callback and using the provided utility functions (getMemRegionFromExpr and REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE for state management), you can readily detect the ordering bug where xa_alloc is called before referencing the exec_queue is secured by xe_file_get.
