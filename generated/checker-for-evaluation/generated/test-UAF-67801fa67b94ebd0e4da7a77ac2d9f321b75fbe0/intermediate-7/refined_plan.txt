1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ExecQueueInitMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
     – This map records for each exec_queue object (represented by its memory region) whether its critical field “xef” has been initialized.
   • (Optionally) REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)  
     – Use this to track aliases if the exec_queue pointer is propagated via assignments.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   A. In checkBind:
      • When a binding is made, check if the left-hand side corresponds to the “xef” field assignment.  
      • Use AST matching (or check via getNameAsString() on the field) to detect assignments to “q->xef”.  
      • On detecting such an assignment:
         – Retrieve the corresponding MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) for the exec_queue object.
         – Update the ExecQueueInitMap for this region to true, and propagate to any aliases stored in PtrAliasMap if set up.
   
   B. In checkPostCall:
      • Intercept call events and check if the callee is “xa_alloc”.  
      • When a call to “xa_alloc” is found:
         – Extract the third argument (argument index 2) which should be the exec_queue pointer.
         – Retrieve its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
         – Look up this region in ExecQueueInitMap: if the value is false (or not set), it indicates that the global registration via xa_alloc was performed before fully initializing the object.
         – In that case, issue a bug report with a short message such as “Premature registration of partially initialized object”.
   
3. Implementation Summary:
   • In checkBind, monitor assignments to the “xef” field and update the program state so that the exec_queue object is marked as fully initialized.
   • In checkPostCall, when xa_alloc is called, retrieve the exec_queue pointer (argument index 2) and use the ExecQueueInitMap to determine if the object had been properly initialized before registration.
   • Generate a non-fatal error report if the initialization flag is false.

This concise and step-by-step plan uses minimal callbacks (checkBind and checkPostCall) and a simple program state to track the critical initialization flag, making it straightforward to detect the bug pattern.
