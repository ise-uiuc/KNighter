## Bug Pattern

The issue is that the object's unique identifier is published to userspace (via xa_alloc) before the object is fully “anchored” by acquiring a proper reference (using xe_file_get). This ordering exposes a window where an attacker can trigger a destroy operation (or any other action) on an incompletely initialized object, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
