Your plan is as follows:

──────────────────────────────
1. Setup & Program State
──────────────────────────────
• Define a program state map to track whether an object has been “anchored” (i.e. acquired a proper reference) before its id is published.  
  – Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AnchorMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  – In this map, a key (the object’s MemRegion) maps to a bool flag (true indicates that xe_file_get() has been called on the object).

──────────────────────────────
2. Choose Callback Functions
──────────────────────────────
• Use checkPostCall to intercept function calls from which we can obtain the necessary ordering information.
• (Optional) Use checkBind if additional pointer aliasing tracking becomes necessary, but in this simple case directly processing call arguments should suffice.

──────────────────────────────
3. Implementation Steps in Callbacks
──────────────────────────────
Step 3.1: In checkPostCall – Process Calls to xe_file_get  
 – Identify the call if call.getCalleeIdentifier() has the name "xe_file_get".  
 – Retrieve the return value’s MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr() on the return expression (or the expression assigned to the object’s field).  
 – Update the program state: mark the region as anchored in the AnchorMap by binding the region to true.  
  For example, update the state so that later checks will know that this object now has been properly anchored.

Step 3.2: In checkPostCall – Process Calls to xa_alloc  
 – Intercept calls where the callee name is "xa_alloc".  
 – From the call’s arguments, get the object pointer that is being published (in this patch it is the third argument, corresponding to q in xa_alloc(&xef->exec_queue.xa, &id, q, …)).  
 – Use getMemRegionFromExpr() to retrieve the corresponding MemRegion.  
 – Lookup the object region in the AnchorMap:
  • If the region is either not present or marked as false (i.e. not anchored), then the unique identifier is being published before the object gets a proper reference.
 – If such a case is found, then generate a bug report using generateNonFatalErrorNode() and a short report message (e.g. "UAF: Object’s id published before proper anchoring").

──────────────────────────────
4. Bug Reporting
──────────────────────────────
• Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create your error report.  
• The report message should be short and clear, such as "Potential UAF: Unique id published before anchoring the object".

──────────────────────────────
5. Summary
──────────────────────────────
The checker uses a program state (AnchorMap) to track if an object has been anchored by xe_file_get. In checkPostCall, if the call to xa_alloc attempts to publish the object’s id (taken from the call’s third argument) and the object is not yet marked as anchored, a bug report is issued. This ensures that the ordering issue is detected, preventing the vulnerability where an attacker could use the object’s id prematurely.

Follow these concrete steps to implement your checker.
