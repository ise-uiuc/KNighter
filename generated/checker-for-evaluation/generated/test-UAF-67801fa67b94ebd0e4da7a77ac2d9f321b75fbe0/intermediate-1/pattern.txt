## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is an ordering issue where an object's unique identifier is exposed (via xa_alloc) before the object is fully initialized and safely referenced. This premature exposure allows an attacker or concurrent context to act on the object (for example, destroy it) before the create operation has been fully completed, leading to a use-after-free scenario.
