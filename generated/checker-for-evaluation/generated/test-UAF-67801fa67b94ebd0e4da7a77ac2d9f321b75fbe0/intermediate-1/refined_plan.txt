1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a map (e.g. ExposedQueueMap) using:
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ExposedQueueMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     This map tracks the object (queue) regions for which xa_alloc has been called. The boolean value indicates that the object's unique id has been exposed (true).

2. Use Callback Functions:
   a. In checkPostCall:
      – When a call event is encountered, check if the callee identifier equals "xa_alloc".
      – If so, identify and extract the queue pointer argument (the object pointer parameter, typically the one that is later used for assignment to xef).
      – Using getMemRegionFromExpr, obtain the MemRegion corresponding to that queue.
      – Update the ExposedQueueMap state by mapping this region to true.
      – This signals that the object's id is exposed before its initialization is complete.

   b. In checkBind:
      – For every binding operation (assignment), check if the left-hand side (destination) is a member field access.
      – Use AST helpers (or cast the LHS to MemberExpr if appropriate) and check if the field name is "xef" (or a similar identifier indicating that the object is being finished initializing).
      – Retrieve the base object (for example, using findSpecificTypeInParents to climb the AST and get the object that owns the field).
      – Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the base object to obtain its MemRegion.
      – Consult the ExposedQueueMap in the current program state. If the object has been marked as exposed (true), then the assignment to that field is occurring after its unique id was allocated.
      – At that point, generate a bug report with a clear, short message (e.g. "Premature uid exposure leads to potential UAF").

3. Bug Reporting:
   • Use a reporting helper (for example, by constructing a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport) to emit the warning.
   • The warning should indicate that the object’s id is being exposed (via xa_alloc) before the initialization of its reference (the xef field).

4. Additional Details:
   • No advanced pointer aliasing tracking is necessary unless you want to cover cases where multiple aliases of the same object exist. However, if needed you can also REGISTER a PtrAliasMap as described in the suggestions.
   • The ordering check is the key: the call to xa_alloc must appear only after the assignment to the xef field. If you see the binding to xef after you have seen xa_alloc for the same object, then report the bug.
   • Keep your check as simple as possible with only these two callbacks.

This plan gives you concrete steps to implement a checker that flags the ordering issue leading to a use-after-free due to premature exposure of an object’s unique identifier.
