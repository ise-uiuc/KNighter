Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide on program states:  
 • No custom program state maps are needed for this checker because the bug can be detected by analyzing condition expressions in real time.

2. Choose the callback function:  
 • Use the checkBranchCondition callback to hook on if statement conditions, since we need to inspect the boundary-check expression.

3. Implement checkBranchCondition:  
 a. In checkBranchCondition, analyze the condition expression.  
 b. Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator> to search for a binary operator within the condition.  
 c. If a binary operator is found and its operator type is “>”, inspect its right-hand operand.  
 d. Use the provided utility function ExprHasName to determine if the right-hand expression’s source text contains the macro name "RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX" (or the corresponding target macro). This indicates the boundary constant is being used in the check.  
 e. If the condition uses “>” instead of “>=” with the macro constant, then this is likely the off-by-one error.

4. Report the bug:  
 • If the above pattern is detected, immediately generate a bug report.  
 • Use a short message such as "Off-by-one error: incorrect array index boundary check" and report it using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport).

This simple four-step plan—hooking the branch condition, identifying the problematic “>” check involving the macro constant, and reporting a concise bug message—should let you write the required checker with minimal complexity.
