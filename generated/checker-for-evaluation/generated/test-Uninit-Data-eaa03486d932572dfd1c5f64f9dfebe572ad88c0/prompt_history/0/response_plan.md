Your plan should be as simple and concrete as the following:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program States:
   • No custom program state is needed. This checker deals with detecting an uninitialized local variable based solely on AST analysis.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use the checkASTCodeBody() callback to inspect every function definition that contains a body.
   • Additionally, you can traverse DeclStmt nodes within the function body to locate variable declarations.

3. Implementation Steps in checkASTCodeBody():
   a. For each function with a body, traverse its AST to visit all DeclStmt nodes.
   b. For each DeclStmt, look for a VarDecl whose name is exactly "ret". Use methods like VarDecl::getNameAsString() to retrieve the variable identifier.
   c. Check if the VarDecl has an initializer. If no initializer is present, then the variable is declared uninitialized.
   d. Optionally, also check if “ret” is later used in a ReturnStmt. You can use findSpecificTypeInChildren() with ReturnStmt to verify its usage within the same function.
   e. If the variable “ret” is uninitialized and it is eventually used (for example, being returned), then this clearly matches the bug pattern.

4. Reporting the Bug:
   • Generate a bug report with a short, clear message (for example: "Local variable 'ret' declared without initialization").
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to create the report.
   • Emit the report immediately in checkASTCodeBody once the bug pattern is detected.

------------------------------------------------------------
This plan relies solely on AST traversal within the function’s code body (via checkASTCodeBody) to detect an uninitialized error variable “ret.” No pointer alias tracking or additional program state maps are needed in this case. Follow these steps to implement your checker.
