1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UninitRetMap, const VarDecl*, bool)
     – This map will record the initialization status of any local variable named “ret”.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   a. checkPostStmt (for DeclStmt):
      – In checkPostStmt, inspect each DeclStmt for declarations of a local variable.
      – For every VarDecl whose name is “ret” and of an integral type:
          ▪ If it has no initializer, record it in UninitRetMap with a value of false.
   b. checkBind:
      – In checkBind, whenever a value is bound to a variable (i.e. an assignment occurs):
          ▪ Check if the left-hand side is a DeclRefExpr referring to a VarDecl with the name “ret”.
          ▪ If so, update the corresponding entry in UninitRetMap to true to indicate that it is initialized.
   c. checkPreStmt (for ReturnStmt):
      – In checkPreStmt, for each ReturnStmt:
          ▪ Analyze the return expression.
          ▪ If the expression is a DeclRefExpr referring to a variable named “ret”, lookup its initialization status in UninitRetMap.
          ▪ If the status is false (i.e. uninitialized), generate a bug report indicating that an uninitialized “ret” is being returned.
      – Use a short and clear report message such as: "Uninitialized local variable 'ret' returned."

3. Bug Reporting:
   • Once a ReturnStmt is found returning an uninitialized “ret”, create a bug report by:
       – Generating a non-fatal error node.
       – Emitting a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with the clear message.
       
Overall, the checker flow is simple:
   - When a local “ret” is declared without an initializer, mark it uninitialized.
   - When “ret” is assigned a value (via checkBind), mark it as initialized.
   - Finally, when “ret” is returned (via checkPreStmt on ReturnStmt), check its initialization status and warn if it remained uninitialized.
