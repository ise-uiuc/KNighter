1. Customize Program State:
   • Use a program state map to track the initialization status of local variables named “ret”. For example, declare a map with
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UninitVarMap, const VarDecl*, bool).
   • When a variable “ret” is declared without an initializer, record it in this map with a value of false (i.e. uninitialized).

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   a. checkPostStmt (for DeclStmt):
      • Traverse each DeclStmt and examine every VarDecl.
      • For each VarDecl whose name is “ret” and that lacks an initializer, add an entry in UninitVarMap marking it as uninitialized.
   b. checkBind:
      • Every time a binding occurs (i.e. when a value is assigned to a variable), check if the left-hand side corresponds to a “ret” variable.
      • If so, update its entry in UninitVarMap to true (i.e. mark it as initialized).
   c. checkPreStmt (for ReturnStmt):
      • When visiting a ReturnStmt, inspect its return expression.
      • If the return expression is a DeclRefExpr referring to “ret”, consult the UninitVarMap.
      • If “ret” is still uninitialized (i.e. the map has a false value), report a bug with a short and clear message such as “Uninitialized variable ret used.”

This simple three-step approach lets you detect cases where a local “ret” variable is declared without an initializer and then later used (via return or in error‐handling paths) without being assigned. Use the provided utility functions for AST traversal and bug reporting as needed.
