## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the use of a local variable (in this case, "ret") without providing it an initial value before its potential use in return or error-handling paths. This can lead to situations where the function returns an undefined (uninitialized) value if none of the code paths set "ret" explicitly, resulting in unpredictable behavior.
