Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on custom program states

• REGISTER a map to track whether a given memory region (representing a structure instance) has been properly initialized. For example, use:  
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UninitStructMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
  If a region is uninitialized (hasn’t been zeroed out), mark it as true; after a memset call that zeroes the region, update it to false.

• REGISTER a pointer‐aliasing map to track when one pointer is bound to another so that if one region is checked, its aliases get the same state. For example:  
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose callback functions

a. checkPostCall – Process memset calls  
 • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to functions like “memset”.  
 • Check the callee name (using ExprHasName or getNameAsString) to confirm it is “memset”.  
 • Use EvaluateExprToInt on the “fill” argument to ensure it is zero.  
 • Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the first (pointer) argument to obtain the target MemRegion.  
 • In the program state’s UninitStructMap, mark that region as “initialized” (i.e. update the flag to false).  
 • Propagate any aliasing information via the PtrAliasMap if needed.

b. checkPreCall – Intercept calls copying data to user space  
 • In checkPreCall, catch calls to user-copy routines (e.g. “copy_to_user”, “copy_to_user_iter”, “simple_copy_to_iter”).  
 • Identify the source argument that contains the structure being copied.  
 • Retrieve the memory region associated with that pointer using getMemRegionFromExpr.  
 • Look up that region in UninitStructMap. If found and if the flag remains true (i.e. the memory has not been zeroed), then it is likely that the structure or its padding remains uninitialized.  
 • Report the bug with a short message such as “Uninitialized structure copied to user space.”

c. checkBind – Handle pointer aliasing  
 • In checkBind, when one pointer is bound to another, update the PtrAliasMap so that both the original region and its alias share the same initialization state.  
 • Do not modify the UninitStructMap here; just record alias relationships. When one pointer becomes marked (through memset) as initialized, use the PtrAliasMap to update its aliases accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation summary

Step-by-step:
 1. At function entry, for any locally declared structure that might be later used in a copy-to-user, assume its memory is uninitialized and (if possible) record it in UninitStructMap as true.  
  (This step may be implicit if you choose to mark as uninitialized only when you see a memset call; the key is that if no memset occurs, the region remains flagged.)

 2. In checkPostCall, when a memset call is detected that zeros a region:
  – Confirm the “fill” parameter is 0.
  – Retrieve the target memory region and update its entry in UninitStructMap to false.
  – Also update any aliases using PtrAliasMap.

 3. In checkPreCall, when a call to a user-copy function is detected:
  – Determine the source pointer expression.
  – Retrieve its MemRegion.
  – Check UninitStructMap: if the region (or any of its aliases via PtrAliasMap) is still flagged as uninitialized (true), report an error.

 4. In checkBind, capture aliasing by recording whenever a pointer is bound from one memory region to another.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Reporting

• When reporting the bug, generate a non-fatal error node and emit a bug report with a short, clear message (for example, “Uninitialized structure copied to user space”) using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

------------------------------------------------------------

This step-by-step, concrete plan—with program state maps and the associated callbacks using checkPostCall, checkPreCall, and checkBind—provides a simple yet complete checklist for detecting if an uninitialized structure (or one with uninitialized padding) is copied to user space.
