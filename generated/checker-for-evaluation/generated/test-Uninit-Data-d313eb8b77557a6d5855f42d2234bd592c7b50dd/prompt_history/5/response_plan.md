1. Customize Program State:
   • Register a map to track the initialization state of memory regions that hold a structure of type "tc_skbmod". For example, use 
     REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(InitMap, const MemRegion *, bool)
   • The key will be the MemRegion representing the structure (e.g. “opt”) and the value will be “true” if it has been zeroed (initialized) or “false” if not.

2. Use checkPostCall to Detect Zeroing (memset):
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to memset.
   • When a call is detected, check that its first argument (pointer expression) refers to a variable of type "tc_skbmod". Use utility functions like getMemRegionFromExpr and, if necessary, further inspect the type.
   • If the pointer corresponds to the structure (for example if the source text contains "opt" or the type deduced is tc_skbmod), update the InitMap for that memory region marking it as initialized (set to true).

3. Use checkPreCall to Detect Unsafe Memory Copy:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to functions that copy memory to user space such as nla_put and/or nla_put_64bit.
   • For each intercepted call, examine the argument that is the source pointer for the data being copied.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr to retrieve its memory region and then query the InitMap. If the region belongs to a structure of type "tc_skbmod" and either is not found in the map or is marked as uninitialized (false), then a potential kernel infoleak is present.
   • At that point, emit a bug report with a concise message (for example, “Uninitialized structure with internal padding may lead to kernel infoleak”).

4. (Optional) Use checkBind for Pointer Alias Tracking:
   • If the structure’s address is ever assigned to another pointer, use checkBind to track aliasing via a PtrAliasMap registered with program state.
   • In such cases, ensure that updating the initialization state for one region updates its aliases as well.
   • This step is optional if you determine that in the current scenario the direct use of the variable (like “opt”) is sufficient to detect the bug pattern.

In summary, the checker will mark the memory region as initialized only if a memset call properly zeroing out the structure is observed in the function (using checkPostCall on memset). Then, during any user-space copying call (using checkPreCall on functions like nla_put), the checker will verify if the data being copied comes from an uninitialized region. If so, it will report the potential kernel-infoleak.
