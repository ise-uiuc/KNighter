1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UninitStructMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will track local structure regions flagged as “uninitialized” (true) or “properly zeroed” (false).

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • In checkPostStmt (for DeclStmt):
     – For each declaration, check if it is a local variable of a record (struct) type that can contain padding.
     – Retrieve its MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
     – Mark the region as uninitialized (true) in UninitStructMap if no explicit initialization is detected.
   
   • In checkBind:
     – When a binding occurs (e.g. the result of a memset call), determine if the memset call is zeroing a local structure.
     – Use utility functions (e.g., EvaluateExprToInt) to extract the size argument from memset.
     – If the destination of memset (retrieved by getMemRegionFromExpr) is in our UninitStructMap and the memset covers the entire structure (size matches), update its flag to false (initialized).

   • In checkPreCall:
     – Intercept calls that copy data to user space (for example, functions like nla_put, copy_to_user, etc.).
     – Examine the call’s source argument (the structure being copied) and retrieve its MemRegion.
     – Look up the region in UninitStructMap: if it remains flagged as uninitialized (true), generate a bug report.
     – The bug report message should be short (e.g., "Local structure with padding not zero-initialized may leak uninitialized bytes").

3. Implementation Summary:
   • When a local record variable is declared, insert its region into UninitStructMap as uninitialized.
   • When memset fully zeroing the structure is detected in checkBind, mark the corresponding region as properly initialized.
   • In checkPreCall, before the structure is copied to user space via known functions, check the map. If the region is still uninitialized, report the potential kernel information leak.

This concise plan leverages minimal callbacks and program state tracking with utility functions to clearly detect the intended bug pattern.
