Your plan:

1. Customize a program state map:
   • Register a map (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(StructInitMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) that tracks whether a structure (e.g., “opt”) has been fully zeroed (true = zeroed).

2. Choose callback functions:
   • In checkPostCall:
     – Intercept calls to memset.
     – Check if the first argument of memset is an expression referring to a local structure (by using getMemRegionFromExpr).
     – If the memset call clears the entire structure (by comparing the memset size with sizeof(structure)—if determinable via EvaluateExprToInt or similar), update the program state map to mark that memory region as initialized (set flag to true).

   • In checkPreCall:
     – Intercept calls to functions that copy data to user space (e.g., copy_to_user, copy_to_user_iter).
     – Identify the argument that is the source buffer. Use utility function getMemRegionFromExpr to retrieve its region.
     – Check the program state map for that region. If the region is present and not marked as “initialized” (or absent, meaning not memset‐cleared), report a bug with a short message (e.g., “Structure with potential uninitialized padding copied to user space”).
     
3. Implementation details:
   • In checkPostCall, use the function’s callee name (via Call.getCalleeName()) to filter for memset.
   • In checkPreCall, compare the callee name against “copy_to_user” and any similar variants.
   • For the source argument in checkPreCall, you may need to navigate the AST to correlate it with the previously allocated local structure.
   • If pointer aliasing is possible and you want to refine tracking, you can also register a PtrAliasMap via REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*) and update it in checkBind. However, for this simple checker, tracking the direct region via getMemRegionFromExpr should suffice.

4. Bug reporting:
   • When the source structure is found uninitialized, generate a warning using a non‐fatal bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short message.

This simple plan uses just two callbacks and a basic program state map to determine whether a structure is fully zeroed out before it is passed to the user space copying functions.
