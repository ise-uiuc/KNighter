1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:  
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(InitializedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)  
     – This map will associate each local region (e.g. the tc_skbmod variable) with a Boolean flag that indicates whether or not it has been fully initialized (true if fully cleared via memset, false otherwise).  
   • Optionally, REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*) to track aliasing. This will allow the checker to propagate the “initialized” status to any aliases of the local variable.

2. Choose callback functions and implement their steps:

   a. checkPostStmt (or checkASTDecl for local declarations):  
      – In the function body (particularly in tcf_skbmod_dump), detect the declaration of the local variable of type tc_skbmod.  
      – Store the MemRegion for the variable in the InitializedMap with a default status “false” (i.e. uninitialized).  
      – (Optionally) also record the region in the PtrAliasMap if pointer aliasing is expected later.

   b. checkBind:  
      – In checkBind, intercept assignments where the memory variable is bound.  
      – If the binding is from a call to memset (detected using ExprHasName on the call expression with “memset”), and the memset argument represents the address of the local variable, update the InitializedMap for that region to “true”.  
      – Additionally, use the PtrAliasMap to propagate the “initialized” flag if the local variable is copied to another alias.

   c. checkPreCall:  
      – Intercept calls to functions that copy data to user space (e.g. functions that eventually invoke nla_put, copy_to_user, etc.).  
      – For each such call, inspect the arguments that are passed as the source buffer. Use getMemRegionFromExpr to extract the MemRegion.  
      – Check if the region corresponds to the local variable (or any alias thereof) that is stored in InitializedMap.  
      – If the region is found and its flag remains “false” (i.e. no memset was applied), then generate a bug report indicating “Kernel infoleak: partially initialized structure copied to user space.”  
      – Use a short message and emit the bug report via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) and mark the error node as non-fatal.

3. Summary of implementation steps:  
   – Register and initialize the custom program state (InitializedMap, optional PtrAliasMap) when a function begins.  
   – In checkPostStmt (or checkASTDecl), detect local declarations for the target structure (tc_skbmod) in tcf_skbmod_dump, storing the region as uninitialized.  
   – In checkBind, detect the memset call on the target structure — update the memory region in InitializedMap to “true” when memset is applied.  
   – In checkPreCall (or checkLocation if you prefer to intercept memory accesses), identify when the uninitialized structure is used as a source for copying to user space. Retrieve its region using getMemRegionFromExpr, and if it is still uninitialized, report the bug.  
   – Utilize simple pointer analysis (via PtrAliasMap and checkBind) to ensure that any aliases of the region inherit the initialization state.

This concise plan uses the simplest steps to check that the structure is completely zeroed out before its use in a copy-to-user operation.
