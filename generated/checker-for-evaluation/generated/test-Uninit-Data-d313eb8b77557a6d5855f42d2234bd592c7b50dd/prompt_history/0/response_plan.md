Your plan:

1. Customize Program State:
   • Create a map called ZeroInitMap via REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ZeroInitMap, const MemRegion *, bool). This map will record, for each memory region representing a candidate structure, whether it has been zero-initialized (true) or not (false).

2. Hook memset to Mark Zero Initialization:
   • Use the checkPostCall callback to intercept calls to memset.
   • In checkPostCall, if the callee’s name is "memset" and the second argument evaluates to constant zero, examine the first argument (the target pointer).
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr to retrieve the MemRegion of the given structure.
   • Update ZeroInitMap for that region marking it as zero-initialized (true).

3. Detect Memory Copy to User Space:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to catch calls to functions that copy memory from kernel to user space (for example, functions like copy_to_user, nla_put, nla_put_u16, etc. – target the ones used in the bug pattern).
   • For each such call, identify the argument that is used as the source buffer being copied.
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr to retrieve the memory region of that argument.
   • Look up this memory region in ZeroInitMap.
     – If the region is not in the map or its flag is false (i.e. not zero-initialized), this indicates that the structure might contain uninitialized data.
   • If such a case is detected, report a bug by generating a non-fatal error node and emitting a short, clear bug report (for example “Uninitialized structure copied to user space”).

4. (Optional) Track Aliasing via checkBind:
   • If the structure pointer may be assigned to other variables (aliases), intercept those assignments in checkBind.
   • Update an alias map (e.g., PtrAliasMap registered via REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) so that if one alias is marked as zero-initialized, all its aliases are updated accordingly.
   • This step ensures that even if the structure pointer is propagated, the zero-initialization status is not lost.

5. Reporting:
   • When a potential bug is detected (i.e. the structure used as a buffer is not zeroed), issue a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with the message “Structure may not be zero-initialized before copying to user space.”

This plan minimizes steps by tracking only the necessary memory region state with ZeroInitMap, intercepting memset to mark safe structure use, and then checking copying functions to report errors when an uninitialized structure is copied.
