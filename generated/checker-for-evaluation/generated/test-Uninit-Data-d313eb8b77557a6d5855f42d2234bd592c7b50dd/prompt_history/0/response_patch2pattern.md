## Bug Pattern

Not zero-initializing a structure that contains padding or holes before copying it to user space. This can lead to kernel information leaks since uninitialized bytes in the buffer (especially in structures with holes) may be inadvertently copied out. The fix is to zero the structure (using memset or a zero-initialization function) before setting its fields.
