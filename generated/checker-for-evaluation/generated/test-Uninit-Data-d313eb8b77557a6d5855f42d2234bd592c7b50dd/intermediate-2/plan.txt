1. Customize Program States:
   • Define a program state map to track whether a stack-allocated structure has been fully zeroed. For example, use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(StructZeroedMap, const MemRegion*, bool). This map will record a memory region as “zeroed” when a memset or equivalent zero-initialization is performed.
   • (Optionally) Define a PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) to track alias relationships so that if one pointer is marked as zeroed, its aliases can also be marked.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • checkPreCall:
     - Intercept calls to functions that copy data from kernel to user space (e.g., copy_to_user, copy_to_user_iter, etc.).
     - For each such call, retrieve the kernel source expression (typically a pointer to a stack-allocated struct) using getMemRegionFromExpr.
     - Use the StructZeroedMap to determine if this memory region has been initialized (zeroed). If not marked as zeroed, raise a bug report.
     - Use ExprHasName if necessary to match the callee names.
   • checkPostCall:
     - Intercept calls to memset.
     - In checkPostCall, when the callee’s identifier is "memset", ensure the first argument points to a memory region.
     - Record that the corresponding memory region is fully zeroed by updating StructZeroedMap for that region.
   • checkBind:
     - Use checkBind to track assignment or aliasing of pointers. When a pointer to a struct variable is assigned to another pointer, update PtrAliasMap so that later the zeroed status can be propagated.
     - When one pointer becomes marked as “zeroed”, also mark its aliases.

3. Detailed Implementation per Callback:
   • In checkPostCall for memset:
     - Verify that the called function is memset (compare callee name using ExprHasName or getNameAsString).
     - Extract the first argument (the destination pointer) and obtain its MemRegion with getMemRegionFromExpr.
     - Update the program state (StructZeroedMap) for that MemRegion to 'true' (i.e., fully initialized).
   • In checkPreCall for copy_to_user calls:
     - Check if the call is a copy_to_user (or similar) using the callee’s identifier.
     - From the call event, retrieve the source expression that is being copied.
     - Get the associated MemRegion from the source expression.
     - Look up this region (or its aliases using PtrAliasMap) in StructZeroedMap. If the region is not marked as zeroed, then report a bug: issue a short, clear message indicating that a potentially uninitialized structure with implicit padding is being passed to user space.
   • In checkBind:
     - Whenever a pointer value is bound to another (assignment or copy), propagate the “zeroed” flag from the source MemRegion to the destination via the PtrAliasMap.
     - This ensures that if one alias is checked, the status remains available when the alias is used in a copy_to_user call.

4. Bug Reporting:
   • In the event of detecting a region passed to copy_to_user that is not marked as zeroed (via StructZeroedMap), generate a non-fatal error node and use a short report message (for example, “Kernel info-leak: partially initialized struct may contain uninitialized padding”).
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create and emit the bug report.

This structured plan – customizing a program state map, tracking memset calls in checkPostCall, checking for uninitialized memory in copy_to_user calls within checkPreCall, and propagating pointer aliases in checkBind – provides a simple yet concrete guide to implement the desired checker.
