Your plan is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State

• REGISTER a map (e.g., UninitStructMap) using
  REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UninitStructMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
to record “tc_skbmod” structure variables that have been partially (or not fully) initialized. In this map, true means the region is still uninitialized (or not zeroed) and false means it has been completely initialized (for instance, by a memset).

----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. checkPostStmt (for Declaration Statements)
 • In checkPostStmt, inspect DeclStmt nodes.
 • Look for a local variable declaration where the type’s name contains “tc_skbmod”. (You can use getNameAsString() on the type.)
 • Further, check if the declaration uses a compound initializer (i.e. an initializer list) that does not list all fields. This is a heuristic for “partial initialization”. 
 • Use getMemRegionFromExpr() to get the MemRegion for the declared variable.
 • If the variable is partially initialized, insert it into the UninitStructMap with value true.

B. checkPostCall (for memset calls)
 • In checkPostCall, inspect call events.
 • If the callee is “memset” (e.g. by comparing the callee’s name), then analyze its first argument.
 • Use getMemRegionFromExpr() on the destination argument.
 • If the destination region exists in UninitStructMap, update its entry to false to indicate full initialization.
 • This models the “fix” where the structure memory is cleared before further use.

C. checkPreCall (for copy-to-user calls)
 • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to functions that copy memory to user space (for example functions with names starting with “nla_put” or similar).
 • Identify the argument where the structure is passed – for instance, check the argument whose address is taken (using getMemRegionFromExpr()).
 • If that MemRegion is present in the UninitStructMap with a value true (i.e. still partially uninitialized), then report a bug.
 • Use a bug reporter (for example, emit a short message via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a clear message such as "Partially initialized structure may leak uninitialized memory").

----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Details per Callback

• In checkPostStmt:
 – For every DeclStmt, iterate through the declared variables.
 – For each VarDecl, check if its type’s name string (via getType().getAsString() or getNameAsString()) contains “tc_skbmod”.
 – Examine if the initializer is a compound initializer with less elements than expected (this heuristic identifies a partially initialized structure).
 – Retrieve the variable’s memory region using getMemRegionFromExpr() and record it in UninitStructMap as true.

• In checkPostCall for memset:
 – When a call to memset is detected (using the callee’s Identifier from CallEvent), extract the destination pointer argument.
 – Look up its MemRegion.
 – If found in UninitStructMap, update the mapping to false (indicating that the memory has now been fully zeroed).

• In checkPreCall for copy functions:
 – Check if the call is to a function that transfers data to user space (e.g. function name “nla_put”, “nla_put_u16”, “nla_put_64bit”, etc.).
 – Pick the right argument (e.g., the one that is the source buffer) and retrieve its MemRegion.
 – Lookup this region in UninitStructMap. If the mapping is present and its value is true, then generate a bug report.
 – Use a simple, clear message (for example "Partial initialization of structure can leak uninitialized memory") when creating your bug report.

----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary

Your checker will:
 – Track “tc_skbmod” structure variable declarations that are partially initialized (via checkPostStmt).
 – Update the state if a memset call overwrites that variable (via checkPostCall).
 – Report an error if an uninitialized (or partially initialized) variable is later used to copy data (via checkPreCall).

----------------------------------------------------------------
This plan uses a minimal set of callbacks with program state tracking in order to catch the kernel-infoleak bug arising from incomplete zeroing of a structure with implicit padding.
