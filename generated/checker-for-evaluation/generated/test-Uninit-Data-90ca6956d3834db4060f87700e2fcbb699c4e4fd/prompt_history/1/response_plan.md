Your plan is as follows:

1. Customize Program States:
   - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(InitPointerMap, const MemRegion *, bool)
     • This map will record each pointer variable (its base region) that is marked with __free(kfree) and whether it has been initialized to NULL (true means safely initialized, false means not).
   - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion *, const MemRegion *)
     • This map will track aliasing relationships so that if one pointer is later assigned another value, the initialization status can be propagated.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   a. checkASTDecl (or checkASTCodeBody):
      • In this callback, iterate over variable declarations in function bodies.
      • For every VarDecl of pointer type, check if its source text contains the cleanup annotation “__free(kfree)” (using ExprHasName or similar source text utilities).
      • If such a variable is found, check whether it has an initializer.
         – If an initializer exists, try to evaluate it (using EvaluateExprToInt or simply compare its source text) to see if it is explicitly set to NULL.
         – If the pointer is explicitly initialized to NULL then record it in the InitPointerMap as true.
         – Otherwise (if no initializer or not a NULL constant), record it as false.
   
   b. checkBind:
      • In checkBind, monitor assignments between pointers.
      • When a pointer with __free(kfree) is bound to another pointer (or vice versa), record an alias in PtrAliasMap.
      • When one pointer is known to be properly initialized (i.e. its flag in InitPointerMap is true), propagate this status to its aliases so that they are also marked as initialized.

   c. checkEndFunction:
      • At the end of a function, check all pointers recorded in the InitPointerMap.
      • For every pointer that is still marked as false (i.e. was not explicitly initialized to NULL), generate a bug report.
      • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short message like “Auto-cleaned pointer not initialized to NULL” and emit the report.

3. Implementation Details:
   - In checkASTDecl:
     • For every VarDecl, retrieve the corresponding MemRegion with getMemRegionFromExpr.
     • Use the utility ExprHasName to check if the decl’s source text contains “__free(kfree)”.
     • Inspect the initializer; if it exists, evaluate it to see if it is a NULL literal. (For instance, in C you can compare the evaluated integer value to 0.)
   - In checkBind:
     • Carefully update the PtrAliasMap so that aliasing does not let an uninitialized pointer slip by. When a pointer is copied to another, check the current state of its alias and update the map accordingly.
   - In checkEndFunction:
     • Walk through the program state’s InitPointerMap.
     • For each pointer that is still uninitialized (false), generate a non‐fatal error node and emit the bug report.
     
This plan uses the simplest approach: detect the declaration of auto-cleanup pointers by their __free(kfree) annotation, check for explicit initialization to NULL upon declaration, track any pointer assignment through checkBind, and finally issue a bug report at function exit (checkEndFunction) if any pointer remains uninitialized.
