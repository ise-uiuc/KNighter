## Bug Pattern

Declaring pointers with auto-free cleanup attributes (e.g., using __free(kfree)) without initializing them to NULL. If an early exit occurs before these pointers are assigned a valid memory address, the cleanup routines may attempt to free uninitialized (garbage) pointer values, leading to undefined behavior or crashes.
