Your plan here

1. Use a callback on function declarations to check variable declarations inside function bodies. For example, register a callback using checkASTDecl (or checkASTCodeBody) so that every VarDecl is analyzed.

2. In the callback, for each VarDecl, examine if it has an auto-cleanup attribute. You can do this by retrieving the source text of the declaration (or by inspecting the attributes attached) and checking if it contains the “__free(kfree)” pattern. (Hint: You can use the utility function ExprHasName on the initializer’s source range if needed.)

3. For any VarDecl that appears to use the auto-free cleanup attribute, check its initializer:
  a. If no initializer is provided, then the pointer is uninitialized. Report a bug indicating that pointers with auto-free must be initialized to NULL.
  b. If an initializer is present, use EvaluateExprToInt (or another method) to check if the initializer evaluates to zero (i.e. NULL). If it does not, report the bug.

4. When reporting the bug, use a short and clear message such as “Auto-free pointer not initialized to NULL” and use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to generate the bug report.

5. No complex program state tracking (like PtrAliasMap) is needed here because this pattern focuses solely on the initialization state of auto-free pointer declarations.

Follow these concrete steps in your checker’s callback implementation so that every pointer declared with __free(kfree) is either explicitly initialized to NULL or flagged as a potential bug.
