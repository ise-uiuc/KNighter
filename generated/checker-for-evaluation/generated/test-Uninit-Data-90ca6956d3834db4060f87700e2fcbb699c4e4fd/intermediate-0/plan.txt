Your plan should be structured as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program States:
   • No need for additional program state maps. This checker only inspects variable declarations, so a simple analysis of the AST is sufficient.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use checkASTDecl to visit each variable declaration in the AST.
   • Optionally, if you want to catch local declarations inside statement blocks, use checkPostStmt on DeclStmt nodes.

3. Detailed Steps in checkASTDecl:
   • For each VarDecl encountered:
       – Check if the declared type is a pointer.
       – Determine if the variable has a cleanup (free) attribute (for example, by checking if the variable has an attribute corresponding to __free or by examining the source text of the declaration using utility functions like ExprHasName, if available).
       – Verify whether the pointer has an explicit initializer. If no initializer is present (i.e., the pointer is not explicitly set to NULL or any other value), it is likely uninitialized.
       – If a pointer with the cleanup attribute is not explicitly initialized, create and emit a bug report with a short message (for example: “Cleanup pointer not initialized”).

4. Reporting:
   • Use either std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create the bug report.
   • Ensure the message is concise and clearly states that a pointer with automated cleanup is not initialized.

5. Implementation Summary:
   • In checkASTDecl, iterate over every VarDecl.
   • For each VarDecl, if it is a pointer type and the declaration includes a cleanup attribute (e.g., __free(kfree)), check if an initializer exists.
   • When no initializer is found, invoke your bug-reporting mechanism to warn about potential freeing of an uninitialized pointer.
   • Optionally, if similar issues can occur in a statement-level declaration, complement the analysis in checkPostStmt for DeclStmt nodes.

------------------------------------------------------------
Following these concrete, step-by-step instructions will let you write a correct and effective checker for this bug pattern.
