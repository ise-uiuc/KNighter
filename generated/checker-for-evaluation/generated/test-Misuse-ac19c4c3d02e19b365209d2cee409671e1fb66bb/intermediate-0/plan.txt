Plan:

1. Determine Program State:
   - No custom program state maps (like REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) are needed because the analysis involves checking a specific call-site expression without alias tracking.

2. Select Callback Function:
   - Use checkPreCall() to intercept function-call events. This callback will examine calls to copy_from_user().

3. In checkPreCall():
   - Verify that the callee name is "copy_from_user". (You may use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare its name.)
   - Retrieve the third argument (buffer size argument) from the call event.

4. Check for Safe Usage:
   - Use the utility function ExprHasName() on the third argument to see if it already contains "array_size". If it does, then the helper is used and no bug exists.

5. Inspect the Third Argument Expression:
   - Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator>() on the third argument to check if it is a multiplication expression.
   - Confirm that the binary operator is a multiplication (i.e., operator '*').
   - Examine its operands to detect if one operand is a sizeof expression. This can be done by either:
     • Checking the source text of the multiplication expression for "sizeof" (via utility functions), or
     • Recursively searching children nodes for a UnaryExprOrTypeTraitExpr representing sizeof.
   - If the multiplication is present and no array_size() helper is used, this indicates a manual multiplication that might overflow.

6. Report the Bug:
   - If the multiplication pattern is detected without array_size usage, create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport.
   - The bug report should deliver a short, clear message such as "Possible integer overflow in manual buffer size computation" and be associated with the copy_from_user() call site.

7. Finalize:
   - Emit the bug report via the CheckerContext's reporting API.
   - Ensure the checker does minimal work (only analyze the call to copy_from_user) for a straightforward and robust implementation.
