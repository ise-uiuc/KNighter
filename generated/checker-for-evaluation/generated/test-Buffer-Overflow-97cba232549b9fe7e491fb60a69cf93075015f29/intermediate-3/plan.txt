Your plan here

1. (No customization needed for program states)  
   • In this checker, we do not need to set up additional program state maps since the bug is detected by examining the AST structure and the loop condition—not by tracking pointer aliases or symbolic values.

2. (Choose callback functions)  
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept ForStmt nodes (loops). This lets you analyze each loop where array subscripting might occur.

3. (Identify the target loop)  
   • In checkPreStmt, check if the current statement is a ForStmt.  
   • From the ForStmt, extract:  
     - The loop initializer to obtain the loop variable (e.g., i)  
     - The loop condition expression to check if it compares the loop variable against an array size.  
   • Use getNameAsString() on any macro or constant referenced in the condition to detect the specific constant (e.g. “MAX_PIPES”).

4. (Analyze loop condition)  
   • Examine the loop condition to verify whether the upper bound is set to (MAX_PIPES * 2) without adjustment.  
   • If the condition does not subtract 1, then the loop may allow i+1 to exceed the array bounds.

5. (Examine the loop body for array subscripting)  
   • Use findSpecificTypeInChildren to traverse the loop body and identify ArraySubscriptExpr nodes.  
   • For each ArraySubscriptExpr, check if the subscript expression is a BinaryOperator of the form (i + 1) (or equivalent).  
   • Compare the loop variable from the ForStmt with the operand in the binary addition to ensure the accessed index is indeed the loop variable offset by 1.

6. (Correlate findings and report bug)  
   • If a loop satisfies both:  
     - The loop condition does not restrict the iteration to (MAX_PIPES * 2) - 1  
     - And the loop body contains an array access using an index expression of the form i + 1  
   • Then trigger a bug report indicating that the loop may result in out-of-bound access.  
   • Use generateNonFatalErrorNode and std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a clear, short message like “Array buffer overflow: index i+1 may exceed array bounds.”

By following these concrete steps in checkPreStmt, and using utility functions (like findSpecificTypeInChildren and getNameAsString for macro condition checks), you will be able to detect loops that iterate too far and access an element at i+1 without proper bound checking.
