1. Callback Selection – Use checkASTCodeBody:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, traverse every function body and search for ForStmt nodes.
   • For each ForStmt, analyze its sub-statements and condition expressions.

2. Detecting the Off‐by‐One Pattern in the Loop:
   • Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<ForStmt>(...) to detect ForStmt nodes.
   • Once in a ForStmt, extract the loop condition expression using AST utilities. Use Lexer::getSourceText (as in ExprHasName) to obtain its textual representation.
   • Check if the loop condition is formulated as “i < (MAX_PIPES * 2)” and does not subtract 1. For this, examine the condition text for the presence of “MAX_PIPES” and “* 2” while ensuring the text does not contain “- 1”.
   • In the body of the loop, look for an ArraySubscriptExpr. Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<ArraySubscriptExpr>(...) to locate an instance where the subscript expression is a binary operator performing addition (i.e. “i + 1”).
   • Use utility functions like ExprHasName or direct string comparisons (after using getSourceManager and getSourceText) to check that the index expression text contains “+ 1”.

3. Report the Off‐by‐One Bug:
   • If both conditions are present—that is, the loop condition does not subtract one, and the loop body accesses the array using index i+1—generate a bug report.
   • Use generateNonFatalErrorNode (or create an error node with std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short, clear message such as “Off-by-one error in loop boundary causing potential buffer overflow.”
   • Report the bug using the CheckerContext’s report function.

4. No Customized Program State:
   • No need to maintain pointer aliasing or memory state maps here since the analysis is localized to loop condition and array subscript expressions.

Each step is straightforward:
• In checkASTCodeBody, iterate over all ForStmt nodes.
• For each, retrieve and examine the loop condition source text.
• Then traverse the ForStmt’s children to locate an ArraySubscriptExpr that uses i + constant (where constant equals 1).
• If the loop condition text indicates an iteration up to “MAX_PIPES * 2” (with no “- 1”), combine this information and issue the diagnostic.

This concise step-by-step plan allows you to implement a checker that detects situations where a loop iterates too far and subsequently accesses an out-of-bound element (i+1), leading to a potential buffer overflow.
