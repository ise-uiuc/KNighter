1. Decide if custom program state is needed:
   • No custom program state (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE or similar) is required for this checker since it only needs to analyze the loop condition and array subscript expressions.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to scan functions that might contain the bug.
   • Use checkPreStmt to examine ForStmt nodes within the function.
   • Optionally, use checkBind if you need to track local loop variable bindings, but in this case it is not necessary.

3. Steps to implement the checker:
   a. In checkASTCodeBody, identify the function body of get_host_router_total_dp_tunnel_bw by examining the FunctionDecl’s name.
      – Only process the function if its name equals "get_host_router_total_dp_tunnel_bw".
   
   b. Traverse the function’s AST to locate the ForStmt node.
      – In checkPreStmt, check if the Stmt is of type ForStmt.
      
   c. Once a ForStmt is found, analyze its loop condition and loop body:
      – For the loop condition, use AST traversal to find if the upper bound is expressed as (MAX_PIPES * 2) (or a similar constant expression).
         • Evaluate the condition with EvaluateExprToInt where applicable.
      – In the loop body, use findSpecificTypeInChildren to search for an ArraySubscriptExpr that accesses the dc->links array.
      
   d. Verify the suspicious array access:
      – Check that the index expression of the array subscript is a binary operator representing an addition.
         • Confirm that one operand is the loop variable (e.g., "i") and the other is a constant literal equal to 1.
      – If the index is constructed as (i + 1) and the loop runs up to (MAX_PIPES * 2), then i+1 may exceed the valid upper bound (off-by-one error).
      
   e. Once the off-by-one error pattern is detected, generate a bug report:
      – Use the reporting functions (e.g. generateNonFatalErrorNode) to create a bug report message that briefly indicates “Off-by-one buffer overflow” or similar.
      – Make sure the report message is short and clear.

4. Summary:
   • The checker inspects the function get_host_router_total_dp_tunnel_bw.
   • It hooks the ForStmt, analyzes its condition and the array subscript expressions.
   • It reports the bug if the loop condition does not subtract one while the loop body accesses array index (i+1).

This plan keeps the implementation simple with a direct AST traversal in checkASTCodeBody and checkPreStmt without any extra program state tracking.
