## Bug Pattern

Accessing an array element out-of-bounds due to an incorrect loop termination condition. The code iterates up to MAX_PIPES * 2 while improperly using a lookahead (i + 1) within the loop. When i reaches the last valid index, adding one exceeds the bounds of the dc->links array, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
