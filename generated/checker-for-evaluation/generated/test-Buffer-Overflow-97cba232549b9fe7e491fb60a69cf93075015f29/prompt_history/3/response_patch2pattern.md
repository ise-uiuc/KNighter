## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is iterating over an array with a loop where an element is accessed at index i+1 without ensuring that i+1 stays within bounds. In this case, accessing dc->links[i + 1] without adjusting the loop condition results in reading beyond the allocated array when i reaches the last valid index.
