Your plan here

1. Use checkASTCodeBody to hook into functions with bodies. In that callback, check if the current function is get_host_router_total_dp_tunnel_bw. This way you can limit your analysis to the target function.

2. Inside the function body of get_host_router_total_dp_tunnel_bw, traverse the AST to find ForStmt nodes. You can iterate over each ForStmt in the function body.

3. For every ForStmt encountered, examine its components:
  a. Get the loop condition expression. Use getSourceText (via Lexer::getSourceText) to retrieve the source string representing the loop’s condition.
  b. Check if the condition contains the macro expression "MAX_PIPES" and the multiplication by 2, but does not subtract 1. That is, the condition is of the form “i < MAX_PIPES * 2” rather than “i < (MAX_PIPES * 2) - 1”. You may use getNameAsString() if the loop boundary comes from a macro.
  c. Traverse the ForStmt’s body to search for ArraySubscriptExpr nodes. For each array access:
   – Verify that the base expression corresponds to dc->links.
   – Analyze the subscript expression and check if it is a BinaryOperator that performs an addition (i + 1). You can use AST matching or recursive AST traversal to detect that pattern.

4. If you find that in a ForStmt both conditions occur – the loop condition allowing i to reach MAX_PIPES * 2 (without subtracting 1) and an array access involving (i + 1) on dc->links – then that indicates a potential buffer overflow.

5. When the buggy pattern is detected, generate a bug report. Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short, clear message like "Array index out-of-bounds: loop condition allows (i+1) to exceed dc->links array bounds". Then emit the report via the CheckerContext.

6. As no pointer aliasing or tracking is needed here, you do not need to customize the program state or use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE.

In summary, your checker will rely on checkASTCodeBody to target the specific function, identify the problematic ForStmt through string comparisons in the loop condition (using the source text utility) and AST child inspection to catch the (i+1) array subscript. This concise analysis should be sufficient to detect the described out-of-bound access bug.
