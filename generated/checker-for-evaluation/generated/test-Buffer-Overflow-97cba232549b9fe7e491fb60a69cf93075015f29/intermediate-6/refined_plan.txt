Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on program state customization

• For this check it is not necessary to customize or register any new program state maps. Since the bug pattern concerns an out‐of-bound array access due to an extra offset (i+1) in a loop that does not restrict the iteration properly, we can perform a localized analysis on the AST node and its surrounding loop context.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose callback functions and implement the checker

A. Use the checkBind callback:
   • In the checkBind callback, inspect every binding where a value is stored in a variable.
   • Look for cases where the bound value comes from an array subscript expression.
   • Within the array subscript expression, use AST utilities (such as findSpecificTypeInChildren) to identify if the index expression is a binary operator with an addition (“+”) where one operand is a loop variable and the other is a literal 1.
   • Also check that the array’s base is the target of the bug pattern, i.e. it should be a member access on “dc->links”. (You can use ExprHasName to check if the expression text contains "dc->links".)

B. Identify the loop context:
   • Once an array access with an offset is found, use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents<ForStmt>() (or find a similar ForStmt node) to retrieve the surrounding loop.
   • Extract the loop’s condition expression from the ForStmt.
   • Analyze the loop condition text (possibly via getSourceText) to determine if the upper bound subtracts one (i.e. if it uses “< ( ... ) - 1”) rather than the full array length.
   • Alternatively, if you can evaluate the expression using EvaluateExprToInt, verify that the loop upper bound guarantees that “i + 1” is not out of bounds compared with the known array size.

C. Report the bug:
   • If the checker determines that the loop condition does not ensure that “i + 1” remains within valid bounds, generate a bug report.
   • Use a simple error report (for example, create a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short message such as “Potential buffer overflow: array index offset may exceed the allocated bounds.”

--------------------------------------------------
3. Detailed implementation steps

Step 1: In checkBind:
   – Check if the right-hand side (RHS) of the assignment is an ArraySubscriptExpr.
   – Within that ArraySubscriptExpr, inspect the index expression:
       • Use either a dyn_cast to BinaryOperator or use our findSpecificTypeInChildren utility to obtain the binary operator.
       • Verify that it represents an addition operation.
       • Confirm that the right operand is a constant integer literal with a value of 1.
   – Additionally, check that the base of the array subscript corresponds to “dc->links” (using ExprHasName).

Step 2: Retrieve the loop context:
   – Use findSpecificTypeInParents<ForStmt>() on the statement node to get its parent ForStmt.
   – Once you have the ForStmt, extract its condition expression.
   – Use Lexer::getSourceText with the condition’s source range to obtain a string representation and check if it subtracts one from the loop’s upper bound.
   – Optionally, if the condition involves constant expressions (e.g. “i < MAX_PIPES * 2”), try to evaluate them (using EvaluateExprToInt) and see whether the bound is off by one.

Step 3: Bug reporting:
   – If the evidence shows that the loop iterates one extra time and thereby “i+1” can access an out-of-bound element, create a bug report.
   – Keep the report message short and clear (for instance, “Potential buffer overflow: offset index may exceed array bounds”).
   – Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to report the bug.

--------------------------------------------------
By following these steps in your checkBind callback (with supporting use of findSpecificTypeInParents and indexing analysis), you can detect the pattern where a loop’s condition is not adjusted for an array access with an offset. This simple and localized analysis avoids extra program state and leverages the provided utility functions for AST traversal and string extraction.
