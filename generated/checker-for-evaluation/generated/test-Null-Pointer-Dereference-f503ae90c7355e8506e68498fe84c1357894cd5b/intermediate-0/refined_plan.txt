Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Use Program State Maps:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PossibleNullPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map stores the pointers returned from mt76_connac_get_he_phy_cap and marks if they have been null-checked (true) or not (false).
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
     – This is optional for tracking pointer aliases so that if one alias is null-checked, its other aliases are marked as such.

2. Record the Return Value in checkPostCall:
   • In checkPostCall, detect calls to mt76_connac_get_he_phy_cap by comparing the callee’s name.
   • Once the call is identified, obtain the returned pointer’s base MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr.
   • Add the retrieved region to PossibleNullPtrMap with a value of false (i.e. “not null checked”).

3. Marking Checked Pointers in checkBranchCondition:
   • In checkBranchCondition, inspect the condition for a potential null check on the pointer.
   • Look for conditions of the forms “if (!ptr)”, “if (ptr != NULL)”, or similar. For detection, you can use utility functions like ExprHasName to see if the pointer variable is mentioned.
   • Once you determine that the pointer (or one of its aliases) is being checked against NULL, update the PossibleNullPtrMap (and corresponding entries in PtrAliasMap if needed) to true. This ensures that later dereferences will not trigger a warning.

4. Detecting Dereferences in checkLocation:
   • In checkLocation, monitor load operations (i.e. dereferences).
   • If the pointer region being dereferenced exists in PossibleNullPtrMap and is still marked as false, emit a bug report.
   • Use a short bug message such as “Missing NULL check for mt76_connac_get_he_phy_cap return value.”
   • Generate a non-fatal error node and create a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) to notify the user.

5. (Optional) Track Pointer Aliases in checkBind:
   • In checkBind, when a pointer is assigned to another (aliasing), record the alias relationship in PtrAliasMap.
   • Ensure that when a pointer is updated as null-checked in checkBranchCondition, its associated aliases are also marked as null-checked.

--------------------------------------------------
This plan follows a simple, step-by-step approach:
– By initially flagging the return value in checkPostCall,
– Using checkBranchCondition to catch proper null-checking,
– And finally using checkLocation to spot any unsafe dereferences,
you can effectively flag the bug pattern of a missing NULL pointer check on the mt76_connac_get_he_phy_cap return value.
