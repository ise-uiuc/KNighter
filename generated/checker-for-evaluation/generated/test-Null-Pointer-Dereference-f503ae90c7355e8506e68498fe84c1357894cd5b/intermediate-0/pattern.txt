## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is the missing NULL pointer check for a function's return value before using it. In this patch, the pointer 'vc' (obtained from mt76_connac_get_he_phy_cap) is dereferenced without verifying that it is non-NULL, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the function fails and returns NULL.
