Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • In this checker there is no need for customized program state maps (like PtrAliasMap) because the pattern is purely arithmetic based. We can check for the multiplication operator and compare the types of its operands directly via AST queries.

2. Choose the Callback Functions:
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept BinaryOperator nodes in the AST. This is because the bug pattern involves detecting when a multiplication (i.e. operator "*") is used.
   • Optionally, hook checkBind if you want to later correlate when the multiplication result is directly assigned to a variable. However, to keep it simple you can just perform a quantitative check directly in checkPreStmt.

3. Implementation of checkPreStmt:
   • In your checkPreStmt callback, verify if the given statement is a BinaryOperator.
   • Check that the operator is multiplication.
   • Retrieve the types of both LHS and RHS expressions. You can use AST type queries (for instance, get the QualType of the subexpressions).
   • Determine if the two operand types are different and if one of them is of a type known to be large (like dma_addr_t in the kernel) while the other is a narrower integer type.
   • If this unsafe multiplication pattern is found, then call your bug reporting mechanism (for example, using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short and clear message such as "Unsafe multiplication with mixed types may cause integer overflow."

4. Further Checks (Optional):
   • You can also use a helper function to extract type names (for example, via getNameAsString()) and compare them to "dma_addr_t" or other target type names if necessary.
   • If you need to cover the multiplication in assignments (where the product is directly assigned), you can extend your checkBind callback to see if the RHS of the binding is a multiplication expression and then perform the same type analysis.
   • Lastly, check any branch conditions (via checkBranchCondition) only if you want to detect conditional checks that attempt to mitigate the multiplication result. This is optional since the key issue is the arithmetic itself.

5. Bug Reporting:
   • In your checkPreStmt when the bug is detected, generate a non-fatal error node and create a bug report with a clear and concise message.
   • Use the utility function ExprHasName if you need to check for specific macro names in the expression; this might help if the multiplication uses a macro for one of the operands.

Following these steps will provide a simple yet effective static analysis to catch unsafe multiplication with mixed types and help avoid inadvertent integer overflow in the target kernel code.
