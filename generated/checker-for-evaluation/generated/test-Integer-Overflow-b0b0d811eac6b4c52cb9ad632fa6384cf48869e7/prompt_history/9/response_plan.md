Your plan:

1. Decide on program state customization:  
   • No new program state maps are needed for this checker because the bug pattern is purely based on arithmetic type mismatch rather than pointer or state tracking.

2. Choose callback function:  
   • Use checkASTCodeBody. This callback is called for every declaration with a statement body, and it allows you to traverse the function’s AST to look for multiplication expressions.

3. Traverse the AST and locate multiplication expressions:  
   • In checkASTCodeBody, traverse the function body and visit all BinaryOperator nodes.  
   • Filter these nodes to consider only those with the multiplication operator (i.e. operator*).

4. Check the operands’ integer types:  
   • For each multiplication expression, retrieve the types of the left and right operands.  
   • Verify that both operands are integer types.  
   • Determine if the two operands have different integer types (for example, differences in bit width or signedness). You can use the type’s QualType information and helper routines provided by the Clang AST library.

5. Report the bug if operands differ:  
   • If the two operands belong to different integer types (which could lead to unintended overflow due to implicit type conversion), generate a bug report.  
   • Create a short and clear message such as “Multiplication of variables with different types may cause integer overflow.”  
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to generate the warning.

6. Finalize the implementation:  
   • No further alias or pointer-tracking is necessary here, so you can keep the implementation minimal.  
   • The entire logic is encapsulated in checkASTCodeBody with an AST traversal focused on binary multiplication operators.

By following these steps, you can detect cases where different integer types are multiplied, causing a potential overflow, and report them concisely.
