## Bug Pattern

Performing arithmetic multiplications directly on variables of different integer types (for example, combining dma_addr_t and int) without first ensuring consistent types or proper conversion. This can lead to unintentional integer overflows due to implicit type conversion or insufficient precision when the multiplication operands have differing sizes.
