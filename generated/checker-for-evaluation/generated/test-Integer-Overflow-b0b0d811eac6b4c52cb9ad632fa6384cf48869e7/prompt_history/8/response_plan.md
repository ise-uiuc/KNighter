Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. No customized program state maps are required for this checker.

2. Choose the Callback Function:
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to hook on BinaryOperator nodes. The multiplication operator (e.g., “*”) can be intercepted here.

3. Implement checkPreStmt:
   • In checkPreStmt, check if the statement is a BinaryOperator.
   • Verify that the BinaryOperator is a multiplication operator.
   • Examine the types of both operands:
       - Use the AST type information to determine if one operand is of type dma_addr_t (or a typedef alias for an unsigned 64-bit address) and the other operand is of an integer type (e.g. int) of a different type.
   • Additionally, detect if the operation is directly used in assignments (for example, in an assignment to a dma_addr_t or a variable computed using dma_addr_t arithmetic).
   • If you find that a multiplication is performed between a dma_addr_t value and an integer without isolating the multiplier into a temporary int variable, then:
       - Report a bug with a short and clear message (e.g., “Suspicious multiplier mixing dma_addr_t with int might overflow”).

4. Reporting the Bug:
   • In the found case, generate a non-fatal error node.
   • Create a bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with the message indicating potential unintentional integer overflow.
   • Emit the report to alert the user.

5. Summary:
   • Only use checkPreStmt to inspect multiplication binary operators.
   • Use AST type queries to identify the suspicious multiplication of different types.
   • Report the bug if the multiplication is not isolated in an int variable.

------------------------------------------------------------
Following this plan, you can write a concise checker that detects arithmetic operations where a dma_addr_t variable is multiplied directly with an integer, which may lead to unintentional overflow.
