Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. No customized program state is needed.
   • We do not need to track aliasing or state between nodes since the bug pattern is isolated to a single multiplication expression.

2. Choose the callback function:
   • Use checkPreStmt to intercept BinaryOperator nodes.
   • In checkPreStmt, filter for BinaryOperator expressions whose opcode is multiplication ("*").

3. In checkPreStmt:
   • When a BinaryOperator is encountered, first verify that it is a multiplication operation.
   • Retrieve the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) operands from the BinaryOperator node.

4. Determine the operand types:
   • Use the AST type information (e.g. Expr->getType()) for both operands.
   • Use getAsString() on each QualType or a similar mechanism to obtain the type names.
   • Alternatively, use ExprHasName utility (if available) on the operands to check if one of them is a dma_addr_t (e.g. the text “dma_addr”) whereas the other is an int or another integer type.  
   • Also, check that the two integer types have different widths/signedness. This indicates a mixed-type multiplication.

5. Trigger a warning when conditions are met:
   • If you detect that one operand is of type dma_addr_t (or its equivalent string) and the other is a different integer type (like int) and the multiplication is performed directly, then this is likely an unintentional overflow risk.
   • Generate a report with a short, clear message (for example: "Mixed integer multiplication may overflow.") using a bug report creation function such as std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>.

6. Report the bug:
   • In checkPreStmt, after detecting the risky multiplication, use the provided CheckerContext to emit the bug report.

--------------------------------------------------
Following these steps, your checker will look for multiplication operations between operands of different integer types (specifically signaling operations involving dma_addr_t) that could lead to integer overflows. This plan is simple, self-contained, and each step is concrete enough to allow straightforward implementation.
