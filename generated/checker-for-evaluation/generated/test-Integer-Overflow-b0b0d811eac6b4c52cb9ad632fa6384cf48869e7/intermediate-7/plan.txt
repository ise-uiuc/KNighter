Your plan here

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states  
 • In this case no custom program state maps (like REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) are needed because the analysis does not involve aliasing or tracking memory regions.  
 • The checker only needs to inspect arithmetic expressions and compare operand types.

2. Choose callback functions  
 • Use the checkASTCodeBody callback to visit every function that contains a statement body.  
 • Within checkASTCodeBody, traverse the AST of the function body (for example, by implementing a simple RecursiveASTVisitor) to specifically look for BinaryOperator nodes that use multiplication (“*”).

3. Implement the BinaryOperator analysis  
 a. In the visitor, when a BinaryOperator node is encountered, first check if its opcode is BO_Mul (multiplication).  
 b. Retrieve both operands (LHS and RHS) and confirm that both have integer types.  
 c. Compute the bit width or use ASTContext’s getTypeSizeInBits() for both operands.  
 d. Also check for type names (for instance, if one of them is defined as “dma_addr_t”)—you can use getType()->getAsString() or getNameAsString() on related Decl information—to see if the types are coming from different definitions.  
 e. If the bit widths (or type names) differ (e.g. one is 32 bits and the other is 64 bits), then this operator is suspect for an unintentional overflow.

4. Generate a bug report  
 • If the condition in step 3e is met, generate a bug report with a clear and short message such as “Potential integer overflow in multiplication of variables of different integer types.”  
 • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to build and emit the warning.

5. Use Utility Functions as needed  
 • Although none of the provided Utility Functions are strictly required for this pattern (since we’re not dealing with memory region tracking or pointer aliasing), you can borrow techniques from them—such as retrieving source text—to help confirm that the multiplication is performed on variables whose names or types indicate potential danger.

By following these concrete steps, you can easily implement a checker that inspects multiplication operations, compares the integer types of the operands, and reports a warning if they differ in size or represent different kinds of integer types (like dma_addr_t vs. int).
