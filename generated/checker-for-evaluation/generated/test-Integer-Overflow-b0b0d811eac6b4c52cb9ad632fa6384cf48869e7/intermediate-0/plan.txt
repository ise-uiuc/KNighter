Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program State  
 • No additional program state is required because this checker is not tracking pointer aliasing or taint information. Our focus is solely on detecting mixed-type arithmetic expressions.
 
2. Choose Callback Function  
 • Use the checkBind callback. This callback gives you access to assignment statements where the right‐hand side (RHS) is an arithmetic expression that could be problematic.

3. Detailed Steps in checkBind  
 a. In the checkBind callback (arguments: (SVal Loc, SVal Val, const Stmt *S, CheckerContext &C)), first verify that S corresponds to an assignment or binding where an arithmetic expression is used.  
  – You can check if S is an Expr that is an assignment (or contains one).

 b. Traverse the RHS expression to search for BinaryOperator nodes (use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren<BinaryOperator> on S).  
  – Focus on binary operators that perform multiplication or addition.

 c. For each BinaryOperator node found, inspect the two operand types.  
  – Retrieve the QualTypes of both operands (e.g. by calling the appropriate member functions or analyzing the expression text using getNameAsString).  
  – Check if one operand is of type dma_addr_t (or contains a token “dma_addr_t” in its source text) and the other operand is an integer type (such as int, unsigned int, etc.).  
  – Also check for scenarios where both the multiplication and/or addition are conducted in a single expression combining differing types.

 d. If a mixed-type arithmetic operation is identified (i.e. an operation mixing dma_addr_t with an integer type), then generate a bug report.  
  – Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a short, clear message such as:  
   "Mixed-type arithmetic between dma_addr_t and integer may cause overflow."  
  – Emit the bug report via the CheckerContext (e.g. C.emitReport(...)).

------------------------------------------------------------
By following this plan—hooking assignment via checkBind, traversing the RHS for binary operators, checking the operand types, and reporting the issue when mixed-type arithmetic is detected—you’ll obtain a simple, clear, and effective CSA checker for the target bug pattern.
