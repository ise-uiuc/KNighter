1. No need to create customized program state maps; the analysis can be done by directly examining the AST nodes.

2. Use the checkPreStmt callback:
   • In checkPreStmt, inspect BinaryOperator nodes. Focus on nodes where the operator is multiplication (i.e. *).
   • For each multiplication operation, retrieve the left-hand side and right-hand side expressions.
   • Check that both operands are integer types. Use Clang AST utilities (e.g. getType()) to get their types.
   • Compare the two operand types. If they differ (for example one is dma_addr_t and the other is int), mark this multiplication as potentially problematic.
   • Optionally, check if this multiplication is contained in an assignment (by looking upward in the AST with findSpecificTypeInParents) or in a return expression where the resulting type may be smaller than one of the operands.

3. Issue a bug report:
   • When a suspicious mixed-type multiplication is detected, generate a short warning message such as “Mixed-type multiplication may lead to integer overflow.”
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) to create and emit the bug report.

4. (Optional) Use utility functions as needed:
   • Use findSpecificTypeInParents to identify assignment contexts, if you want to narrow reporting to places where the result is stored or used.
   • Use getNameAsString on macro values if the multiplication involves macros—this can help in comparing against certain target strings if necessary.

This straightforward approach (using checkPreStmt to catch multiplication operations and verifying the operand types) minimizes extra steps while ensuring that any mixed integer multiplication is flagged as a potential overflow risk.
