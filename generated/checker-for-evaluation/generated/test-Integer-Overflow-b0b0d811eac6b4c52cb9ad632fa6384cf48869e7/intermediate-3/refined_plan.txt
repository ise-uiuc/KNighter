Your plan here

1. Decide if it's necessary to customize program states:
   • No additional program state maps (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) are needed because the checker only needs to inspect arithmetic expressions and compare their types; there is no pointer aliasing or state tracking required.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to inspect BinaryOperator statements. In this callback, filter for multiplication operators.

3. In checkPreStmt (for BinaryOperator):
   • First, check if the statement is a BinaryOperator.
   • Verify that the operator is a multiplication (the '*' operator).
   • Retrieve both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) operands of the operator.

4. Analyze the operand types:
   • Inspect the type of each operand.
   • Check if the multiplication involves operands of different integer types—for example, one operand being of type dma_addr_t and the other an int (or any other mismatched integer type combination).
   • Optionally, ensure that at least one of the types is a typedefized integer (like dma_addr_t) that is prone to causing overflow issues when multiplied directly with a smaller integer type.

5. Issue a bug report:
   • If such a multiplication is detected, generate a warning using a simple error report (for example, via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>).
   • The report message should be short and clear, e.g., "Mixed type multiplication may lead to unintentional integer overflow."

6. (Optional) Further refinement:
   • If desired, use utility functions like ExprHasName to check for macro usage (if a multiplication comes from a macro like DIV_ROUND_UP and is then saved into a variable), although this is optional if your primary target is the arithmetic operation itself.
   • Keep checks simple—directly compare the types as strings or use the AST type APIs to determine mismatches.

Following these concrete steps in the checkPreStmt callback will allow you to identify potential bug patterns where the multiplication of mixed integer types may result in unintentional overflow.
