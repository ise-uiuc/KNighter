Your plan is as follows:

1. Use a callback for statements that contain multiplication:
 • Register your checker to visit multiplication expressions. The simplest way is to use the checkPreStmt callback to inspect BinaryOperator nodes.
 • In checkPreStmt, first check if the current statement is a BinaryOperator with the multiplication operator (*).

2. In checkPreStmt, inspect the multiplication expression:
 • Examine both the left-hand side and the right-hand side operands.
 • Retrieve the types of both operands (e.g. by calling getType()).
 • Compare the types. In particular, if one type is “dma_addr_t” (or contains that type name string) and the other is an “int” (or another type with different size or signedness), then it is a potential problem.
 • You can use the provided utility function ExprHasName by obtaining the source text of the operands if needed (or use the DeclarationType/Type name comparison) to recognize the target types.

3. Report an issue:
 • When you have detected multiplication between mismatched types, emit a bug report with a short message such as “Multiplying operands of different types may lead to overflow.”
 • Utilize the analyzer’s bug reporting mechanisms (e.g. create a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport) so that the error node is generated at the location of the multiplication.

4. (Optional) Minimal State Management:
 • For this simple arithmetic check you do not need to manage complex program state maps or pointer aliasing. No REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE is needed.

Summary of the callbacks you will use:
 • checkPreStmt: For intercepting each BinaryOperator. In your implementation, check if it is a multiplication operator, then retrieve and compare the types of its operands to decide if a report should be generated.

Follow these concrete steps:
 1. In checkPreStmt, detect if the current Stmt can be cast to a BinaryOperator.
 2. If it is a multiplication operation, obtain the left-hand side and right-hand side expressions.
 3. Use the type information (or source text with utility function ExprHasName if necessary) to check if the operands are of different types (e.g. one “dma_addr_t” and one “int”).
 4. If the check passes, immediately generate a bug report at the location of the multiplication with a concise message.
 5. No additional pointer or alias tracking is necessary.

This plan is simple and direct while ensuring that you catch the bug pattern where different operand types are multiplied in a single expression, which could avoid the unintended integer overflow issue.
