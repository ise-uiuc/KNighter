Your plan here

1. Determine that no extra program state maps are needed because the checker only needs to inspect the source text of branch conditions within loop constructs.

2. Use the callback function checkBranchCondition to hook branch conditions:
   • In checkBranchCondition, obtain the source text of the condition using the provided utility function (ExprHasName) or Lexer utilities.
   • Inspect the condition’s text for the specific string "dc->caps.max_links". This indicates that the loop or if condition is using the incorrect upper bound.
   • Optionally, traverse upward (using findSpecificTypeInParents) to verify that this condition is part of a ForStmt or similar loop construct.

3. Generate a bug report if the condition contains "dc->caps.max_links":
   • Create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short message like "Incorrect upper bound: use mode_info.num_crtc instead of dc->caps.max_links".
   • Emit the report via the CheckerContext.

4. No pointer alias or taint tracking is needed, so you do not require additional checkBind or program state modifications.

By following these steps in checkBranchCondition, you can effectively detect the bug pattern where the incorrect upper bound is used in iteration, and then issue a concise and clear bug report.
