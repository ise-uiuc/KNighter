Your plan is as follows:

1. No customized program states are needed. We are simply looking for the forbidden use of an incorrect boundary in a loop condition.

2. Use the checkBranchCondition callback:
   • In the checkBranchCondition callback, intercept the condition expression of a loop (for example, the loop condition in a for‐loop).
   • Retrieve the source text corresponding to the condition expression (using our utility function ExprHasName or using Lexer to extract the text).
   • Check if the condition contains the string "dc->caps.max_links". (For example, by calling getNameAsString() on the field or by checking the extracted text.)
   • If this string is found, it indicates that the loop is using the external capability field as the boundary.

3. Validate contextual usage (optional but recommended):
   • Optionally, perform a downward search using the provided findSpecificTypeInChildren utility to see if within the same loop body the array "secure_display_ctxs" is being indexed.
   • This extra verification ensures that the loop boundary is critical (i.e. iterating over the secure display contexts allocated with adev->mode_info.num_crtc).

4. Report the bug:
   • When a match is found (i.e. the branch condition uses “dc->caps.max_links”), immediately generate a bug report using a short message such as "Buffer iteration using incorrect boundary (max_links) may lead to overflow." Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> as appropriate.
   • Emit this report via the CheckerContext’s reporting interface.

This simple plan, using the checkBranchCondition callback and our utility functions such as ExprHasName, allows you to detect when a loop condition is misusing “dc->caps.max_links” instead of “mode_info.num_crtc.”
