## Bug Pattern

Using an incorrect upper bound for iteration and memory allocation. Specifically, the code incorrectly uses adev->dm.dc->caps.max_links (which may be larger than available CRTCs) to determine the iteration count and size of the secure_display_ctxs array, instead of using adev->mode_info.num_crtc. This mismatch in bounds can lead to buffer overflows by accessing unallocated memory.
