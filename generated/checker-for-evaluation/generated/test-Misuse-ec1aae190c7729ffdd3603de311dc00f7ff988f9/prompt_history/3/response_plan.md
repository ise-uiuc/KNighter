Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Detect the Target Function:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, identify when the function being analyzed is brcmf_fweh_process_event. You can use the function’s name (using getNameAsString()) to restrict the analysis to this target.

2. Locate the Two Key Operations:
   • Traverse the AST of brcmf_fweh_process_event’s body.
   • Use an AST visitor (or recursive helper) to look for:
     - An assignment (or bind) to the “datalen” field (i.e. event->datalen). You can detect this by checking if the left-hand side of an assignment has a MemberExpr with field name “datalen”.
     - A memcpy call where the destination argument is event->data (the flexible array member). Use the Utility Function ExprHasName to check if the destination expression contains “data” (or verify if it is a MemberExpr with field “data”).

3. Compare Source Order of the Two Operations:
   • Once you have found both statements in the function body, retrieve their SourceLocations (using the SourceManager).
   • Check if the memcpy that accesses the flexible array member (event->data) appears before the assignment updating the counter (event->datalen).
   • If the memcpy happens earlier than the datalen assignment, then the flexible array is accessed with an uninitialized counter.

4. Report the Bug:
   • If the check confirms that event->data is accessed (via memcpy) before event->datalen is updated, generate a bug report.
   • Keep the report message concise, e.g. “Flexible array member accessed before its length counter is updated.”
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create this report.

------------------------------------------------------------
Callback and Implementation Details:

• checkASTCodeBody:
  - First, filter to process only the function with name "brcmf_fweh_process_event".
  - Recursively traverse the function’s statement body to locate the two key operations (assignment to datalen and memcpy to data).
  - Save the source locations for both operations.

• AST Traversal:
  - For each statement, if it is a BinaryOperator (or an assignment-like expression), use findSpecificTypeInChildren or simply check if its LHS is a MemberExpr accessing “datalen”. Record its SourceLocation.
  - For each CallExpr, check if the callee’s name is “memcpy”. Then check the destination argument to see if it accesses “data” (using getNameAsString or ExprHasName). Record its SourceLocation.
  - You may only need to record the first occurrence of each operation if there are multiple.

• Comparing Locations:
  - Use the SourceManager to check if the memcpy call’s location precedes the datalen assignment.
  - If so, call C.emitReport with the built bug report.

• Program State:
  - No need to register custom program state maps (like PtrAliasMap) for this check. The analysis only involves ordering of two AST statements.

------------------------------------------------------------
By following these concrete steps in the checkASTCodeBody callback, you can detect the bug pattern where the flexible array member is accessed before the associated length counter is updated.
