Your plan is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State

• REGISTER a new program state map named FlexArrayUpdateMap that maps const MemRegion* (for the event struct) to a bool flag.  
 – Initially, when an event is allocated (via kzalloc), insert an entry with value false indicating that the metadata (datalen) has not yet been updated.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

a. checkPostCall (for allocation site)  
 • When a call to kzalloc is intercepted, use getMemRegionFromExpr() on the return value.  
 • Confirm that the allocation is intended for the event structure (e.g. by checking the presence of the flexible-array member “data”).  
 • Insert into FlexArrayUpdateMap with key = event’s MemRegion and value = false.

b. checkBind (for metadata update)  
 • In checkBind, examine assignments that bind a value to a location.  
 • Detect when an assignment targets the "datalen" field (use ExprHasName() with "datalen").  
 • Find the parent event struct from that field assignment using findSpecificTypeInParents().  
 • If found, update the FlexArrayUpdateMap entry for that event region to true, marking that the metadata update has been executed.  
 • Also update any aliases if you keep an alias tracking map (PtrAliasMap) so that all pointers to the same event record are updated.

c. checkPreCall (for memcpy access)  
 • Intercept calls to memcpy in checkPreCall.  
 • For memcpy, retrieve the destination parameter; verify that it corresponds to the flexible array member "data" (use ExprHasName() on the destination expression to check for “data”).  
 • Get the parent event struct of that flexible array using findSpecificTypeInParents().  
 • Look up its region in FlexArrayUpdateMap.  
 • If the metadata flag is still false (i.e., event->datalen has not yet been updated), then report a bug using a short and clear message such as “Out-of-order metadata update: flexible array accessed before datalen update.”  
 • Use generateNonFatalErrorNode and then create a bug report with either BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Detailed Implementation Steps

Step 1. In checkPostCall:  
 – Detect the allocation call (kzalloc) that returns the event pointer.  
 – Retrieve the allocated event’s MemRegion using getMemRegionFromExpr() on the return value.  
 – Insert an entry in FlexArrayUpdateMap with the key as that region and value = false.

Step 2. In checkBind:  
 – When a binding is performed, check if the LHS is a field reference with the name "datalen" (employ ExprHasName with “datalen”).  
 – Use findSpecificTypeInParents() on the LHS to obtain the parent event struct.  
 – Update FlexArrayUpdateMap for that event’s region to true.  
 – Also update the PtrAliasMap if alias tracking is used.

Step 3. In checkPreCall:  
 – When intercepting memcpy calls, get the first argument (destination).  
 – Confirm that the destination points to the flexible array member (i.e. the text of the expression contains “data”).  
 – Use findSpecificTypeInParents() on the destination expression to retrieve the event structure’s region.  
 – Query FlexArrayUpdateMap for that region.  
 – If the flag is false, use generateNonFatalErrorNode and report the bug with a concise message.  

--------------------------------------------------
4. Summary

• Customize a program state (FlexArrayUpdateMap) to record whether the datalen update has occurred for a given event.  
• Use checkPostCall to mark newly allocated events as not updated.  
• Use checkBind to mark event->datalen as updated when the assignment occurs.  
• Use checkPreCall to identify a memcpy call to the flexible array member, then check the update flag.  
• Report an error if memcpy is called before the metadata is updated.
