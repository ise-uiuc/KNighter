1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER a map with program state (e.g. FlexCounterUpdatedMap) to track whether the counter field (datalen) has been updated. Use:
       REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FlexCounterUpdatedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     This map will associate a memory region corresponding to an instance of the structure (e.g. event) with a boolean flag (true meaning datalen has been set).

2. Choose Callback Functions and Their Implementation:

   a. checkBind (for tracking the datalen update):
      – In checkBind, inspect every binding operation.
      – When the left-hand side expression refers to the field "datalen" (use ExprHasName(E, "datalen", C)),
         retrieve its memory region via getMemRegionFromExpr.
      – Then mark the corresponding region as "updated" in FlexCounterUpdatedMap (set flag to true).
      – If there exists any aliasing of the structure pointer, update them accordingly using an alias map (if needed).

   b. checkPostCall (for intercepting memcpy calls):
      – Intercept calls to memcpy by checking the callee identifier against "memcpy".
      – Retrieve the destination operand of memcpy (the first argument) and use getMemRegionFromExpr to determine the memory region.
      – Use ExprHasName to check if the destination expression (or its parent via findSpecificTypeInParents) represents the flexible-array member “data”.
      – With the destination’s region in hand, query FlexCounterUpdatedMap. If the region (or the containing event structure) is not marked as updated (or its flag is false), it indicates that the counter (datalen) has not been updated before the array access.
      – In that case, issue a bug report with a short, clear message such as “Flexible array counter updated after data access.”

3. (Optional) Check pointer aliasing in checkBind:
   – If you need to track aliasing of the structure pointer that holds both “data” and “datalen”, consider also registering an alias map (e.g. PtrAliasMap) and update it in checkBind when a pointer is assigned to another.
   – This ensures that once one pointer updates datalen, all its aliases are marked as updated.

4. Bug Reporting:
   – When a memcpy call is found to occur before datalen is set, generate a non-fatal error node.
   – Create a bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with a precise message indicating that the counter update for a flexible array member is delayed, which might cause buffer overflow issues.

Following these steps yields a straightforward checker that (i) tracks when the counter field is updated and (ii) verifies that accesses to the flexible-array member occur only after the counter is correctly set.
