1. Decide to customize program states:
   • REGISTER a map with the program state (e.g., REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FlexCounterUpdateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)). This map will record for each allocated event structure (or its flexible-array field) whether its counter (datalen) has been updated.

2. Choose callback functions:

   A. checkBind (for pointer and field assignments)
      • Implement checkBind to intercept assignments.
      • When a binding assigns to a field, use helper logic (e.g., inspect the source text with ExprHasName or analyze the FieldDecl) to determine if the field being assigned is the counter “datalen” of the event structure.
      • If so, get the corresponding composite object’s MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and update FlexCounterUpdateMap with a value of true for that region.
      • Also, if aliasing is possible (e.g., the same pointer is bound to another variable), consider adding an alias tracking (using a separate PtrAliasMap via REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) so that if one alias is marked as updated the others will be too.

   B. checkPreCall (to intercept memcpy calls)
      • In checkPreCall, identify calls to memcpy. Use the CallEvent’s callee name to match "memcpy".
      • Retrieve the destination argument’s expression from memcpy.
      • Use utility function getMemRegionFromExpr to obtain the MemRegion corresponding to the destination.
      • If the destination corresponds to a flexible-array member (e.g., check if ExprHasName indicates it is “data”) then use the program state (FlexCounterUpdateMap) to check if the counter (datalen) for that event structure has been updated.
      • If the FlexCounterUpdateMap does not have an entry or the entry is false, this means the memcpy is being performed before updating the counter; report a bug by generating a non-fatal error node and creating a short, clear bug report (e.g., “Flexible-array counter updated after data access”).

3. Implementation flow:
   • Upon processing an event function like brcmf_fweh_process_event, as soon as the assignment to event->datalen is encountered, checkBind will mark the corresponding MemRegion as updated.
   • Later, when memcpy is invoked to copy to event->data, checkPreCall confirms whether the counter was already updated: a missing update indicates the bug pattern.
   • Report the error immediately if the check fails.

This plan uses the simplest approach with two callbacks (checkBind and checkPreCall) plus a custom program state map, along with pointer aliasing if needed. Follow the detailed steps provided to implement the checker and ensure that every memcpy to the flexible-array member “data” is preceded by an update to its counter “datalen.”
