Your plan here

1. Register a Program State Map:
   • Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DatalenUpdatedMap, const MemRegion*, bool) to record, for each “event” object, whether its size field (datalen) has been updated.

2. Use checkBind to Track the Assignment to the Size Field:
   • In checkBind, inspect bindings whose left-hand side is a MemberExpr.
   • If the member name equals "datalen" (e.g. by checking the source text via ExprHasName or using AST APIs) and its base is the event pointer, then update DatalenUpdatedMap for this event object’s MemRegion to true.
   • Also ensure that you obtain the MemRegion from the event pointer using getMemRegionFromExpr so that later you can use this mapping.

3. Use checkPostCall to Intercept memcpy:
   • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to memcpy.
   • Check if the destination argument of memcpy is a pointer expression whose text contains "data" (i.e. it accesses the flexible array member) by using ExprHasName.
   • Retrieve the base event’s MemRegion from the destination expression (possibly by stripping member access or by calling getMemRegionFromExpr on the base object).
   • Consult the DatalenUpdatedMap: if the event’s MemRegion is not present or is false, then the flexible array member is being accessed before its size-counting field is updated.
   • If so, produce a bug report with a short message (for example, “Flexible array accessed before size field update”) using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

4. Callback Organization Summary:
   • checkBind: Update the DatalenUpdatedMap when an assignment to event->datalen is made.
   • checkPostCall: Detect memcpy calls that copy into event->data and verify that the corresponding event’s datalen was updated prior to the access.
   • Report the issue immediately when the check in checkPostCall fails.

Following these steps and using the provided utility functions (like ExprHasName and getMemRegionFromExpr) will allow you to build a simple and concrete checker for this bug pattern.
