Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Custom Program State:
   • No extra program state maps are required. This checker is purely a local ordering check within a function body.

2. Choose Callbacks:
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to analyze the function’s body.
     – We can limit our analysis only to the function where the bug pattern occurs (e.g. "brcmf_fweh_process_event") or any function that contains a flexible-array access and an update to its counter.
  
3. Implementation Steps in checkASTCodeBody:
   a. When checkASTCodeBody is called, obtain the function’s body (the Decl’s statement).
   b. Traverse the AST of the body in a simple (preorder) fashion to locate:
      • The assignment statement that updates the flexible-array counter.
         – Identify a BinaryOperator (or pseudo-assignment, e.g. an "=" assignment) where the left-hand side is a MemberExpr whose member name is "datalen." Use getNameAsString() on the member to test for "datalen."
      • The memcpy call that accesses the flexible-array member.
         – Identify a CallExpr where the callee is "memcpy" (again, using getNameAsString() on the callee if available). Check the first argument of memcpy: if it is a MemberExpr and its member name is "data," then you have identified a flexible-array access.
   c. Record the source location (start location) for both statements.
      – Use the getBeginLoc() method to get a SourceLocation from each of the two statements.
      
4. Order Verification:
   • Compare the source locations:
      – If the memcpy to the flexible array (accessing "data") is encountered before the assignment update of "datalen," then this represents the bug pattern.
   • As soon as you detect this ordering (the size counter is updated after the data is accessed), prepare to issue a bug report.

5. Reporting the Bug:
   • In the event that the ordering is incorrect, use the bug report creation functions (for example, std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) to generate a brief and clear message such as "Counter updated after flexible array access" (or similar concise message).
   • Emit the report, so the developer is alerted to the potential buffer-overflow risk.

6. Utility Functions Integration:
   • Although not strictly necessary here, you may use getNameAsString() on the MemberExpr extracted via utility function check (compare using getNameAsString() or use ExprHasName utility if a string search on the raw source text is easier).
   • Use findSpecificTypeInChildren if you want to quickly check within a sub-tree (for example, to quickly check if an assignment or memcpy is present in a compound statement).

------------------------------------------------------------
This plan uses a single callback (checkASTCodeBody) to traverse the AST of the function in question. It searches for the two critical operations (the memcpy accessing the flexible array and the assignment updating the counter), compares their source order, and if the assignment comes after the memcpy then it reports an error. This is a simple, straightforward approach that meets the target bug pattern with minimal extra machinery.
