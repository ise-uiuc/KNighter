1. Customize Program State:
   • Register a program state map (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FlexDatalenUpdateMap, const MemRegion *, bool)) that maps each event object’s memory region to a flag indicating whether its counter field (datalen) has been updated. By default, the flag is false.

2. Use checkBind to Track Updates to the Counter:
   • In the checkBind callback, examine every binding operation.
   • If the left-hand side expression contains the field name "datalen" (using ExprHasName), then obtain the memory region for the containing event object (for example, by using findSpecificTypeInParents or getMemRegionFromExpr on the LHS).
   • Update the FlexDatalenUpdateMap for this event region to true, indicating the datalen field has been properly updated.
   • Also update the PtrAliasMap if needed (per suggestion) to propagate the updated flag to any aliases of the event object.

3. Use checkPostCall to Intercept memcpy Calls:
   • In checkPostCall, check if the called function is memcpy.
   • If so, inspect the destination argument to see if it corresponds to the flexible-array member “data”. Use utility functions (for example, ExprHasName to check if the expression text contains "data" or other AST matching helpers).
   • Once an event object is identified from the memcpy destination, retrieve its memory region.
   • Look up this region in FlexDatalenUpdateMap. If the flag is false (i.e. the event’s counter field “datalen” has not yet been updated), then this indicates the bug pattern – that data is copied from the flexible array before updating its length.

4. Report the Bug:
   • If the problematic ordering is detected (memcpy to data before datalen update), generate a non‐fatal error node.
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport with a short, clear message such as "Flexible array accessed before its counter updated" to report the bug.

5. Callback Registration Summary:
   • Register checkBind for pointer and field assignment tracking.
   • Register checkPostCall for function call tracking (specifically memcpy).
   • No extra callbacks are strictly necessary; additional callbacks (e.g. checkASTCodeBody) are not needed as the dynamic ordering can be handled by updating and checking program state in checkBind and checkPostCall.

Following this plan will allow you to detect the bug pattern by ensuring that the update to the counter field (datalen) takes place before any flexible-array data is accessed via memcpy.
