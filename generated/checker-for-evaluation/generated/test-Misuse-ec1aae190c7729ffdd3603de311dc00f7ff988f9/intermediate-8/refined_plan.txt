Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Program State Management

• We do not need to define any custom program state maps in this checker. Instead, we will rely on the AST structure and source location ordering to compare the placement of two statements within the same function.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose the Callback Functions

• Use checkASTCodeBody – This callback lets you examine the complete body of the target function (in this case, the one processing the event). It lets you easily scan the list of statements in order.
  
• (Optionally) Use checkPreCall – This callback intercepts calls (such as memcpy) so that you can quickly check if the destination argument accesses a flexible-array member.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Steps in Detail

Step 1. Identify the Target Function and Statements  
  • In checkASTCodeBody, filter for the target function (e.g., “brcmf_fweh_process_event”) by using getNameAsString() on the FunctionDecl.
  • Traverse the function body in the order of appearance (the AST list of statements).  
  • Look for two events:
  – A call expression to memcpy where the destination argument is a reference to the flexible array member (i.e. “data”).  
  – An assignment statement (or a bind) where the counter field (i.e. “datalen”) is updated.

Step 2. Determine the Order of Operations  
  • When you locate a memcpy() call, examine the destination expression. You can check that the destination refers to the “data” field by looking into its MemberExpr or using the utility function ExprHasName() with the name "data".  
  • Record the SourceLocation (or use a comparable ordering property) of the memcpy call.
  • Then search (or scan backwards) in the same function body for a statement that assigns to “datalen”. Again, you can locate an assignment by checking for a BinaryOperator (assignment) whose left-hand side is a MemberExpr whose accessed field has name “datalen”.  
  • Compare the SourceLocation of the memcpy call and the counter assignment.
  – If the counter update (event->datalen = datalen) appears after the memcpy call, then the counter (which is relied on for bounds-checks due to its __counted_by annotation) is updated too late.

Step 3. Report the Bug if Out-of-Order  
  • If you detect that the flexible array (“data”) is accessed (via memcpy) before the counter (“datalen”) is updated, generate a bug report.
  • Create a brief message (for example: "Flexible array accessed before counter update") and use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to emit the report.
  • Optionally, use the SourceManager (obtained from CheckerContext) to mark the location of the memcpy call as the error location.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Implementation Details in checkASTCodeBody

• In checkASTCodeBody, obtain the function’s body and iterate through its statements in order.
• For each statement:
  – If the statement is a CallExpr and the callee is “memcpy”, then use getSpecificTypeInChildren (if necessary) or check the arguments manually.
  – Inspect the first argument: check if it is a MemberExpr referencing a field with name “data”. Use the provided utility function ExprHasName() to check for "data".
  – Record this call’s location.
• Next, look for an assignment where the left-hand side is a MemberExpr that refers to “datalen”. Again, use ExprHasName() with "datalen" on the LHS.
• Compare the ordering: if the memcpy (data access) occurs and the assignment to “datalen” is found later (or not found at all before the memcpy), then we have detected the bug.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Use of Utility Functions

• Use ExprHasName() to check if an expression refers to "data" (for memcpy’s destination) or "datalen" (for counter assignment).
• Use getNameAsString() on the function declaration to check if you are in the target function (if you want to limit the checker).
• (If needed) use findSpecificTypeInChildren()/findSpecificTypeInParents() to navigate through the AST nodes in the function body.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. Summary

Your checker will implement checkASTCodeBody. It will:
  – Verify that, in the target function, every memcpy() call that copies into the flexible array member “data” has a preceding assignment to the counter “datalen”.
  – Report a bug when the memcpy call is encountered before the counter update.
  
Keep the implementation simple by iterating the statements in order and comparing their source locations. The report message should be short and clear.

------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these concrete steps, and you will have a checker that detects the bug pattern where the counter for a flexible array is updated after the flexible array is accessed.
