Your plan should follow these steps:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program States

• REGISTER a program state map (e.g. TxLockState) to track if the tx lock is acquired.  
  - Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(TxLockState, const MemRegion*, bool).  
  - The key will be the memory region corresponding to gsm->tx_lock, and its boolean flag will be true if the lock has been acquired.

• (Optionally) Register a PtrAliasMap if you need to track aliasing of the tx_lock pointer. This enables updating the lock state for aliases when a pointer is checked.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

a. checkPostCall  
   - Use checkPostCall() to catch calls where the tx lock is acquired.  
   - In checkPostCall, detect a call to the lock acquisition helper (e.g. the function whose source text contains "guard(spinlock_irqsave)").  
   - Check that the callee’s identifier contains the target string (for example, using ExprHasName on the callee’s expression or getNameAsString on its identifier).  
   - Extract the pointer parameter (using getMemRegionFromExpr) that points to gsm->tx_lock and update the TxLockState map marking that region as true (locked).

b. checkPreCall  
   - Use checkPreCall() to intercept calls to deallocation functions such as kfree.  
   - When a call to kfree is detected, examine its argument. Use Utility functions (e.g. getMemRegionFromExpr and ExprHasName) to check if the argument is derived from the tx queues (e.g. "tx_ctrl_list" or "tx_data_list").  
   - Retrieve the current program state from TxLockState.  
   - If the argument (or its alias) is being freed without the tx lock marked as acquired, then generate a diagnostic report indicating potential unsynchronized access (i.e. use-after-free due to lack of the proper lock guard).

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Details

• In checkPostCall:  
   - Compare the callee’s name to the synchronization helper signature (such as checking if it contains "guard(spinlock_irqsave)").  
   - Once identified, use getMemRegionFromExpr on the parameter representing gsm->tx_lock.  
   - Update the TxLockState program state map: set the corresponding region’s flag to true.

• In checkPreCall:  
   - Intercept each kfree call.
   - Use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the argument’s source text contains "tx_ctrl_list" or "tx_data_list".
   - Obtain the corresponding MemRegion.
   - Look up the region (or use your PtrAliasMap to resolve to the canonical lock region) in TxLockState.
   - If the tx lock is not marked (false/missing), then generate a bug report using either std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a short message such as "Freeing tx queue without acquiring tx_lock."

• Optionally, if pointer propagation happens (e.g. via assignments), update your PtrAliasMap in checkBind. In checkBind, when a pointer is stored into another variable, record its alias in the PtrAliasMap. Then use it in checkPreCall and checkPostCall to correlate the lock pointer.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary of Steps

1. Declare a program state map (TxLockState) to track whether gsm->tx_lock is acquired.
2. In checkPostCall, intercept calls to the lock guard function (identified via its name) and mark the corresponding lock's region as acquired.
3. In checkPreCall, intercept calls to kfree and examine if the pointer being freed comes from tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list.
4. If a kfree call is not guarded by an acquired tx_lock in the program state, then report a potential synchronization bug.
5. (Optional) Use checkBind with a PtrAliasMap to propagate lock pointer aliases.

Following this plan, your checker will detect if tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list is being freed without the tx_lock guard, which is the root symptom of the detected use-after-free bug pattern.

This concise plan details the program state customization, selection of callbacks, and step-by-step actions you must implement to write the checker for detecting unsynchronized freeing of tx queues.
