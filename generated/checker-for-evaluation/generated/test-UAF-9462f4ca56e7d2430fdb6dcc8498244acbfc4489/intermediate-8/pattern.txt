## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is unsynchronized access to shared data structures. In this case, the code frees objects stored in shared tx queues (tx_ctrl_list and tx_data_list) without holding the necessary lock, which can lead to a race condition where one thread frees a gsm_msg while another is concurrently using itâ€”resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
