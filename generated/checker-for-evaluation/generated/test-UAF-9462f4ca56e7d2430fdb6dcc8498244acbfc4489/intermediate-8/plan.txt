Your plan:

1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a map using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(GuardLockMap, const MemRegion*, bool) to track the state of the “tx_lock” instance.
   • Optionally, register a PtrAliasMap (if needed) to track pointer aliases for the tx_lock, so that checking one alias updates all related regions.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   A. checkPreCall:
      • Intercept calls that acquire the tx lock. In particular, when a call’s callee has the name “guard” (or matches the locking function used to guard tx queues), use getMemRegionFromExpr on the argument representing gsm->tx_lock.
      • Update the program state: mark the corresponding MemRegion in GuardLockMap as ‘true’ (lock held).
      • Also, intercept call events to kfree. When a call to kfree is intercepted and its location is within the function gsm_cleanup_mux, determine whether the kfree is invoked on an element from the shared tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list.
         - You can optionally examine the source code (via ExprHasName or by finding the corresponding list variable in the AST) to decide if the kfree call frees an object from one of these shared queues.
         - Use the program state (GuardLockMap) to check if the tx_lock is acquired.
         - If not, report a bug using a suitable bug-report mechanism with a short message such as "Unsynchronized free on shared tx queue" (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport).

   B. checkBind (if necessary):
      • When a pointer is bound from one variable to another (e.g. aliasing the lock pointer), update the PtrAliasMap to track that both pointers refer to the same lock.
      • On any subsequent check for the lock’s state, ensure that the alias is considered.
      • (This step is optional if you assume the locking object is uniquely identified by a unique MemRegion.)

3. Implementation Details:
   • In checkPreCall, first check if the Call’s callee identifier corresponds to the locking function (e.g. check that ExprHasName returns true for “guard” applied on gsm->tx_lock).
   • For calls to kfree, verify that the free occurs in the context of gsm_cleanup_mux (e.g. by checking the function name using getNameAsString on the enclosing function Decl) and that the freed object comes from either tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list (if needed, you may use AST navigation utility functions).
   • If kfree is called when the tx_lock is not held (i.e. the corresponding entry in GuardLockMap is not true), immediately generate a warning node by reporting the unsynchronized access.
   • Keep the checker as simple as possible: only track the state for the specific lock used to guard tx queue accesses rather than modeling all locking/unlocking in the program.

4. Summary:
   • Use GUARDED program state maps to track if gsm->tx_lock is held.
   • In checkPreCall, mark the acquisition of the lock and detect the freeing calls from the tx queues.
   • If a kfree call on a shared queue element is executed without the tx_lock held, report the bug with a concise error message.
   • Optionally, incorporate pointer alias tracking through checkBind if there is a need to follow different representations of the same lock.

Follow these concrete steps to implement the checker for detecting the unsynchronized access pattern that may lead to use‐after‐free in the shared tx queues.
