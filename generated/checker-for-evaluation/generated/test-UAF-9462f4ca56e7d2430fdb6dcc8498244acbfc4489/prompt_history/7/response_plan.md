Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide on Custom Program State  
 • No complex state tracking is needed for pointer aliasing here. Instead, the goal is to determine within the cleanup function whether the spin lock for protecting tx lists is acquired prior to list freeing.  
 • Thus, you do not need to register new program state maps.

2. Choose Callback Functions  
 • Use checkASTCodeBody to analyze the body of the function "gsm_cleanup_mux" because the bug originates from missing a lock call before list freeing.  
 • Optionally, you may use checkPreCall if you want to intercept calls to free functions such as kfree and then inspect the context, but the simplest approach is to perform a local AST check in "gsm_cleanup_mux".

3. Implementation Steps in checkASTCodeBody  
 a. Identify the Target Function  
  – In the checkASTCodeBody callback, check if the current function’s name is "gsm_cleanup_mux".  
 b. Detect Presence of a Guard Lock Call  
  – Traverse the function’s body (using an AST traversal or helper functions like findSpecificTypeInChildren) to look for a call whose source text contains "tx_lock".  
  – Use the helper function ExprHasName to check if any call expression’s source text includes "tx_lock" (or "guard" with "tx_lock"), which indicates that the shared resource is protected.  
 c. Detect List Freeing Operations  
  – Continue traversing the function body and locate calls to kfree (for instance, using checkPreCall or an AST walk inside checkASTCodeBody).  
  – For each kfree call, use ExprHasName to check if it is associated with freeing elements from either "tx_ctrl_list" or "tx_data_list".  
 d. Compare the Order of Operations  
  – Ensure that if a kfree call on the tx lists is found, then a protective lock acquisition (the guard call on "tx_lock") appears earlier in the control flow (or in the same sequential block).  
  – A simple approach is to record during the traversal whether a guard call is encountered before any kfree call on the tx lists.  
 e. Report a Bug  
  – If a kfree call on either list is reached before a corresponding guard call (or if no lock is acquired at all), then generate a short, clear bug report (using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport) stating that the cleanup function frees the shared tx queue without holding the tx lock.

4. Summary  
 • In checkASTCodeBody, first check for function "gsm_cleanup_mux".  
 • Traverse its body to look for a guard call that locks "tx_lock".  
 • Then look for the kfree calls which free the tx_ctrl_list and tx_data_list.  
 • If a kfree call is encountered without a prior guard call for "tx_lock", report the potential race (use-after-free) bug.  

By following these steps, you can write a simple and concrete CSA checker for detecting the missing proper locking in cleaning-up dynamic shared structures.
