1. Customize Program State:
   • Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to create a TxLockStateMap that maps a const MemRegion* (pointing to the tx_lock) to a bool indicating if the lock is currently held. This global state allows tracking whether gsm->tx_lock is active when the tx queues are modified.

2. Use checkPreCall to Detect Lock Acquisition:
   • In the checkPreCall callback, look for calls to the locking helper (e.g., a function or macro call that “guards” with spinlock_irqsave).
   • Use the utility function ExprHasName to confirm that the call’s argument contains "tx_lock".
   • If the call is detected, update the TxLockStateMap in the program state by binding the region corresponding to gsm->tx_lock as locked (true).

3. Use checkPreStmt for List Modification:
   • In checkPreStmt (or checkPostStmt) for statements inside gsm_cleanup_mux, examine statements that free or reinitialize the tx queues.
   • Use ExprHasName on the statement’s source text to detect if "tx_ctrl_list" or "tx_data_list" is present.
   • When such a statement is found, retrieve the current program state from TxLockStateMap to verify if gsm->tx_lock is marked as held.
   • If the lock is not held (state is false or missing), immediately report a bug via a short, clear bug report (for example, “tx queue accessed without acquiring tx_lock”).

4. Reset or Propagate the Lock Tracking:
   • In checkEndFunction, once you exit gsm_cleanup_mux, clear or reset the TxLockStateMap to avoid false positives for subsequent functions.
   • Optionally, in checkBind, if any pointer aliasing of gsm->tx_lock occurs, update the TxLockStateMap accordingly using a PtrAliasMap if needed.

By following these steps:
   – You detect when gsm->tx_lock is acquired.
   – You monitor modifications to the shared tx queues.
   – You warn if the queues are accessed without proper synchronization.
This concise plan provides a straightforward path to implement a checker for the improper synchronization bug pattern.
