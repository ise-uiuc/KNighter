## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is unsynchronized access to shared memory during cleanup. In this case, the code frees memory from queues (tx_ctrl_list and tx_data_list) without holding the proper lock (gsm->tx_lock), opening a window for concurrent threads (for example, in ioctl contexts) to access freed memory, leading to use-after-free errors.
