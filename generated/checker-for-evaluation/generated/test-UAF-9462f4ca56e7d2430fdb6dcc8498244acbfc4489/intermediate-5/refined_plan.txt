1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER a map (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) called LockHeldMap with type (const MemRegion* → bool). This map will track whether the critical lock (gsm->tx_lock) is held.

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   A. Tracking Lock Acquisition and Release (in checkPostCall):
      • In checkPostCall, intercept calls to the spin locking API (e.g. spin_lock_irqsave or analogous) that operate on gsm->tx_lock.
         – Use getMemRegionFromExpr or ExprHasName on the call’s argument to identify if the argument is gsm->tx_lock.
         – If so, update LockHeldMap to mark this region as true (locked).
      • Similarly, in checkPostCall, intercept calls to spin_unlock (or spin_unlock_irqrestore) on gsm->tx_lock.
         – Using getMemRegionFromExpr or ExprHasName, check if the unlocking is done on gsm->tx_lock.
         – Then update LockHeldMap to mark the region as false (unlocked).

   B. Detect Unsynchronized Free (in checkPreCall):
      • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to kfree (or related free functions). Use the CallEvent to identify a call to kfree.
      • For each intercepted kfree call, retrieve the argument expression that corresponds to the freed memory region.
      • Use ExprHasName (or similar string matching) to check if the source text of the pointer expression contains "tx_ctrl_list" or "tx_data_list" (the lists that require protection by gsm->tx_lock).
      • If the list is identified, then obtain the corresponding lock region (gsm->tx_lock) which should be stored in LockHeldMap.
      • Check the state of the LockHeldMap for gsm->tx_lock. If the critical lock is not held (value is false or missing), then generate a bug report.
         – Use a simple message such as "Unsynchronized free of shared tx_list in cleanup" for the PathSensitiveBugReport.

3. Implementation Summary:
   • In checkPostCall, update LockHeldMap when the checker sees gsm->tx_lock being locked or unlocked.
   • In checkPreCall for kfree calls, check the alias/source of the freed pointer using the utility function ExprHasName combined with getMemRegionFromExpr.
   • Report a bug if a free on the tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list occurs while gsm->tx_lock is not locked.
   • Keep the steps simple and use the provided utility functions to facilitate string checking and AST navigation.

By following these concrete steps with detailed handling in the selected callbacks, you can implement the checker to detect unsynchronized access to shared memory during cleanup in gsm_cleanup_mux.
