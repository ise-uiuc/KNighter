Your plan here

1. Decide on Program State Customization:
 • No custom program state maps are needed. The bug pattern is purely syntactic (missing a lock guard call) in a known function (“gsm_cleanup_mux”), so we can analyze the function body without maintaining complex state tracking.

2. Choose Callback Function:
 • Use the checkASTCodeBody callback. This callback lets you inspect the complete body of the “gsm_cleanup_mux” function and check for the proper synchronization call.

3. In checkASTCodeBody for “gsm_cleanup_mux”:
 a. First, verify that the analyzed function is indeed “gsm_cleanup_mux” (e.g. by checking the function’s name using getNameAsString()).
 b. Traverse the AST of its body to identify the sequence of statements. Locate the call to unlock the mutex (e.g. “mutex_unlock(&gsm->mutex)”). Note that the subsequent operations (after unlocking) must be protected.
 c. Next, search for the call to tty_ldisc_flush(gsm->tty), which is expected to be present before freeing the transmission queues.
 d. After that, look for statements that free or traverse the tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list. Such statements include loops invoking list_for_each_entry_safe or calls to kfree whose source code text (using ExprHasName) mention “tx_ctrl_list” or “tx_data_list”.

4. Detecting Missing Synchronization:
 a. Using a tree traversal helper (for example, findSpecificTypeInChildren or direct AST iteration), check whether there is any call to the synchronization function pattern: specifically, a call whose source text contains “guard(spinlock_irqsave)” and “tx_lock”. Use the utility function ExprHasName to extract and compare the text.
 b. If you reach the section in the function body that handles the queues (freeing the entries) and you have not encountered a call to the “guard(spinlock_irqsave)(&gsm->tx_lock)” (or any equivalent pattern that acquires the tx_lock), then the checker should consider this a missing lock acquisition.

5. Report the Bug:
 • When the missing synchronization is detected, use a bug reporting function (for example, create a new BasicBugReport via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a clear and short message such as “Missing synchronization for tx_ctrl_list/tx_data_list.” Then, emit the bug through your standard bug-reporting mechanism.

6. Summary:
 • By using checkASTCodeBody on the “gsm_cleanup_mux” function, traverse the statement sequence to detect that after unlocking the mutex the shared transmission queues are accessed without an intervening lock guard call.
 • Utilize utility functions like ExprHasName to verify if the proper guard call exists.
 • On absence of that call before the list-free operations, generate a bug report notifying of potential unsynchronized access.

This concise plan follows a minimal and concrete set of steps, using a single callback to analyze the function’s body and straightforward text search in the AST to detect the presence or absence of the synchronization call.
