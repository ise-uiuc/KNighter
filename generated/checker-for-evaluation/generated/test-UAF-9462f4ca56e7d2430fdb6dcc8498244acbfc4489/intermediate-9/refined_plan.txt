Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State

• REGISTER a program state map called LockStateMap that maps a MemRegion (the shared lock region) to a boolean flag indicating whether the lock is held.  
  • Example: REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(LockStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. checkPreCall  
   – This callback will intercept all function call events.  
   – In checkPreCall, add two kinds of interceptions:

     1. Lock Acquisition Calls:
         • Detect calls to functions that acquire the spinlock (e.g. calls with “guard(…)” or “spin_lock” in their name).
         • Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() or ExprHasName on the call expression to identify if it is a lock-acquisition call.
         • Retrieve the lock object passed as an argument (using the provided utility functions such as getMemRegionFromExpr).
         • Use the program state (LockStateMap) to record that this lock region is now held (e.g. map lockRegion → true).

     2. kfree Calls on Shared List Items:
         • Detect calls to “kfree” by matching the callee name.
         • Retrieve the argument expression passed to kfree.
         • Check whether the argument’s source text contains the names “tx_ctrl_list” or “tx_data_list” (using ExprHasName).
         • If so, retrieve (or infer) the lock region corresponding to “gsm->tx_lock”. (This can be done by scanning upward in the AST or by using additional heuristics with ExprHasName on the expression representing the lock.)
         • Use the LockStateMap to check if the lock for that shared list is held.  
         • If not held (i.e. the boolean flag is false or absent), report a bug with a clear short message like “Unsynchronized free of shared list”.

B. (Optional) checkASTCodeBody  
   – In checkASTCodeBody, when analyzing the function “gsm_cleanup_mux” you can optionally initialize the LockStateMap for the “gsm->tx_lock” region to false, ensuring that you have the correct starting state.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Details for Each Step

Step 1: Program State Map  
   • In your checker constructor or as a static registration, define:
         REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(LockStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
   • This map will later be updated in checkPreCall when a locking call is detected.

Step 2A: Implementing checkPreCall for Lock Acquisition  
   • When a call event is received, check if its callee’s name contains “guard” or “spin_lock”.  
   • If yes, identify the argument that represents the lock (for example, check if its source text contains “tx_lock” using ExprHasName).  
   • Use getMemRegionFromExpr on the argument to get the MemRegion and update LockStateMap by setting its value to true.

Step 2B: Implementing checkPreCall for kfree Calls  
   • When a call to “kfree” is intercepted, first check if its argument’s source text mentions “tx_ctrl_list” or “tx_data_list”.  
   • If so, determine the lock region associated with that shared list (typically “gsm->tx_lock” – you can use utility functions or search upward in the AST for an expression containing the name “tx_lock”).  
   • Look up the lock’s state in LockStateMap.  
   • If the state is not true (i.e. no lock acquisition was recorded), report a bug using a short message (“Unsynchronized free of shared list”) with generateNonFatalErrorNode and a call to C.emitReport(...) via a BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary

• Program State: Use LockStateMap to track if “gsm->tx_lock” is held.  
• Callback: Use checkPreCall to intercept both lock acquisitions and free operations.  
• In checkPreCall:
    – For lock acquisition calls: check function name, extract the lock region, and record its state as held.
    – For kfree calls: if the argument belongs to tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list, verify that “gsm->tx_lock” is held. Otherwise, report a bug.

This plan uses relatively few steps and relies on existing utility functions (like ExprHasName and getMemRegionFromExpr) to simplify pointer and name analyses, ensuring that you can easily follow the design and write a correct checker.
