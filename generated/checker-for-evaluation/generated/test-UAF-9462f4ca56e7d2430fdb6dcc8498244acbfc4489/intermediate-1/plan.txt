1. Use a program state flag:  
   • REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(SpinLockAcquired, bool)  
   – This state flag (set to false by default) will track whether the tx_lock is currently held.

2. Use checkBeginFunction:  
   • At the beginning of the function (gsm_cleanup_mux), initialize SpinLockAcquired to false.  
   – This guarantees that if no spin lock is acquired, the flag remains false.

3. Instrument lock acquisition:  
   • In checkPostCall, check for the call to the spinlock guard function (i.e. a call whose source text or callee name contains "guard" and "tx_lock").  
   • When such a call is detected, update the program state and set SpinLockAcquired to true.  
   – Use ExprHasName to confirm that the call uses "tx_lock".  
   – This records that the shared list deallocations are protected by the spinlock.

4. Detect unsafe deallocations:  
   • In checkPreCall, intercept calls to kfree.  
   • For each kfree call, inspect its argument expression using ExprHasName to check whether it is deallocating from one of the shared lists (i.e., the source text contains "tx_ctrl_list" or "tx_data_list").  
   – This indicates the deallocation of shared objects.
   • Then, query the current program state for SpinLockAcquired.  
   – If the flag is false (i.e. no lock acquired), then this kfree is unsynchronized.
   • Report a bug by creating a short bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or BasicBugReport) with a message like “Unsynchronized deallocation on shared list”.

5. Use checkBind if necessary:  
   • Optionally, if pointer aliasing analysis is needed (e.g., to track that the same shared object pointer flows to other pointers), use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*) in checkBind.
   – This simplifies tracking whether an alias also benefits from the acquired lock.
   – However, for our basic checker, tracking the spinlock flag is sufficient.

6. Overall flow:  
   • Start in gsm_cleanup_mux with SpinLockAcquired set to false.  
   • When the guard(spinlock_irqsave) is invoked, update the state to true.  
   • When a kfree call occurs on an element of tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list, check the flag.  
   • If the flag is false, generate a warning reporting the possible unsynchronized deallocation leading to use‐after‐free.

This concise plan uses the simplest approach with minimal callback functions (checkBeginFunction, checkPostCall, checkPreCall) along with program state management to detect the bug pattern.
