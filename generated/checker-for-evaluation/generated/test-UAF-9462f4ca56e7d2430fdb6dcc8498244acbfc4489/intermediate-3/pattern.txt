## Bug Pattern

Improper synchronization when accessing shared data structures. In this case, the tx queues (tx_ctrl_list and tx_data_list) are modified (freed and reinitialized) without holding the proper lock, allowing racing accesses from multiple threads that can lead to a use‐after‐free vulnerability.
