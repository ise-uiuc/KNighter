1. Customize Program States:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(LockStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will track whether the key region (specifically the tx_ctrl_list and tx_data_list) is currently held under the necessary lock.
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
     – This map helps track aliasing for the list regions; if one pointer is marked as locked, its aliases will be considered locked too.

2. Callback Function: checkPreCall
   • Intercept calls to kfree (or similar functions that free list elements).
   • In the callback, first check if the call is made inside the function gsm_cleanup_mux (by checking the function or context information).
   • Use a utility (like getMemRegionFromExpr) to obtain the MemRegion corresponding to the element being freed.
   • Look up this region in the LockStateMap (or, if necessary, via its alias from PtrAliasMap) to decide if it is protected by the tx lock during the freeing.
   • If the lock state is not “true” (i.e. not held), immediately generate a bug report (using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or similar) with a concise message such as “Race condition: unsynchronized free in tx_ctrl_list”.

3. Callback Function: checkPostCall (or checkPreCall)
   • Intercept calls that acquire the tx_lock. This is typically signaled by a call to a locking helper such as guard(spinlock_irqsave) when passing &gsm->tx_lock.
   • Use utility functions (e.g., ExprHasName, getMemRegionFromExpr) to verify that the target of the lock is the suspected tx_lock.
   • Update the program state “LockStateMap” for the associated MemRegions (tx_ctrl_list and tx_data_list) to true (locked state).

4. Callback Function: checkEndFunction or checkPostCall in the region after the locked block
   • Detect when the lock release occurs (either via an unlock call or when the guarded region ends). For example, if the code structure indicates that the region after the guard is no longer under protection, then update the LockStateMap for the list regions to false.
   • This ensures that subsequent kfree calls outside of a protected region can also be reported.

5. Callback Function: checkBind
   • Use this callback to track assignments where the pointer variable (for example, the pointers to tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list) is copied to another variable.
   • Update the PtrAliasMap in the program state so that when one alias is marked as locked/unlocked via LockStateMap updates, the corresponding aliases are similarly updated.
   • This ensures that later free calls using aliases are correctly analyzed.

6. Bug Reporting
   • When the unsynchronized kfree call is detected (the element is freed without the tx_lock being held), generate a bug report.
   • Use the shortest clear message like “Race condition: unsynchronized access to shared tx list” and emit a nonfatal error node along with the bug report.

Overall, the strategy is to track the lock state over the lifetime of the list variables using a program state map. Lock acquisition updates the map; pointer assignments propagate lock information via the alias map; and any free operation is checked against the lock state in the map. If a kfree call on an element from the tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list happens without the proper lock held, the checker reports the unsynchronized access (use-after-free) bug.
