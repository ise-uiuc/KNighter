1. Determine Callback and Scope:
   • We don’t need specialized program state maps or pointer/alias tracking for this checker.
   • Register a callback via checkPreStmt to inspect every statement for potential left-shift expressions.

2. Detecting Left‐Shift Operations:
   • In the checkPreStmt callback, check if the current Stmt is a BinaryOperator with an opcode corresponding to left shift (<<).
   • Use the AST to verify that the operator is indeed a shift operator.

3. Analyzing the Shift Expression:
   • Once a left-shift operation is found, retrieve the left-hand operand (the value being shifted) and the shift count.
   • Check whether the left-hand operand involves a binary bitwise OR (|) between an expression like (1 << constant) and a variable. This pattern suggests that integer constants and variables are being combined.
   • Inspect the type of the left-hand operand and the resulting shift expression. If the type is a smaller integer type (e.g., 32-bit) rather than a 64-bit type, then it is vulnerable to overflow.

4. Verifying Correct Upcasting:
   • Look for an explicit cast in the left-hand operand. Use a utility function like findSpecificTypeInParents to search up the AST for a CastExpr. The cast should be to a 64-bit type (e.g., u64).
   • If no such cast is present, then the left-shift computation is performed in a potentially unsafe (narrower) integer type.

5. Reporting the Bug:
   • When the checker determines that a left-shift operation is performed on a lower-width integer without the mandatory upcast, create a bug report.
   • Use a concise message such as “Potential integer overflow: upcast to 64-bit missing before left-shift.”
   • Generate the error node using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> and emit the report.

6. Final Integration:
   • Keep the checker implementation simple. In essence, use checkPreStmt to process every left-shift BinaryOperator, analyze its operands and types, and then flag the bug if the upcast to a 64-bit type is missing.

This plan outlines how to match the bug pattern by directly inspecting left-shift expressions and verifying proper upcasting using the AST (and provided utility function findSpecificTypeInParents for cast detection), then reporting the potential overflow issue.
