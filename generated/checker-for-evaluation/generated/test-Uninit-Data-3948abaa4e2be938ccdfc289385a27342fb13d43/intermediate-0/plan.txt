Your plan should follow these concise steps:

1. Register a program state map:
   • Use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UninitMemoryMap, const MemRegion*, bool) to map each allocated memory region to a flag indicating whether it is still uninitialized.
   • (Optionally) use a PtrAliasMap to track alias relationships if you later want to follow pointer copies.

2. In checkPostCall, track memory allocations:
   • If the callee is kmalloc:
  – Retrieve the returned memory region from the call.
  – Update UninitMemoryMap to mark the region as uninitialized (set flag to true).
   • If the callee is kzalloc:
  – Retrieve the returned memory region.
  – Update UninitMemoryMap to mark the region as initialized (set flag to false).
   • Use provided helper function getMemRegionFromExpr for obtaining the allocation’s base region.

3. In checkPreCall, detect potential copy_to_user issues:
   • When intercepting a call to copy_to_user:
  – Retrieve the kernel source pointer argument and obtain its corresponding memory region.
  – Use the UninitMemoryMap to check if this region is still uninitialized.
  – If the region is flagged as uninitialized, report a bug with a short error message such as "Uninitialized kmalloced memory copied to user".
   • Use utility functions to match the callee name and find the region.

4. Generate the bug report:
   • In the reporting routine, generate a non‐fatal error node and create a bug report (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with the concise message.
   • No additional alias analysis is necessary unless pointer propagation makes it likely that an alias to the allocated memory is used later. In that case, update the PtrAliasMap in checkBind.

This plan is straightforward and minimizes extra steps while leveraging the utility functions. Follow these steps in each callback hook so that you can flag the problematic use of kmalloc (instead of kzalloc) leading to potential kernel-infoleaks.
