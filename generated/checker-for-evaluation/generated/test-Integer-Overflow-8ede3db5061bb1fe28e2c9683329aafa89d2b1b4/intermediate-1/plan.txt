1. No need for extra program state maps in this checker since we are not tracking pointer aliases or tainting; we only need to analyze call expressions.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept call events:
 a. In checkPreCall, check if the callee’s name is "check_add_overflow" (by examining Call.getCalleeIdentifier()).
 b. If not, ignore the call.

3. For every call to check_add_overflow, review the first two arguments (which represent the summands):
 a. For each argument, traverse the AST to see if the expression is an explicit cast expression (e.g. CStyleCastExpr) by using an appropriate dynamic_cast.
 b. Inspect the cast: if the cast’s target type is int while the underlying sub-expression is of an unsigned type (for instance, size_t or unsigned long), mark this as a potential bug.
 c. This detection can be implemented by checking the type of the sub-expression (using AST type queries) and comparing it with the casted type.

4. If a problematic cast is detected:
 a. Generate a bug report immediately using a non‐fatal error node.
 b. Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message like "Casting unsigned value to int in check_add_overflow bypasses proper overflow detection" to report the bug.

5. Keep the implementation simple by concentrating the check solely in the checkPreCall callback and not introducing any additional state or pointer alias tracking.

This step‐by‐step plan gives you a precise approach to implement the checker.
