Your plan here

1. It is not necessary to define custom program state maps for this checker; we only need to analyze the AST structure in the call events.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback to hook function calls. In this callback, you will detect calls to the overflow-checking function "check_add_overflow".

3. Inside checkPreCall:
   • First, verify that the called function’s identifier is “check_add_overflow”. You can use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() for this.
   • Then, retrieve the function call’s arguments. In particular, focus on the arguments that come from casting operations.

4. For each call to "check_add_overflow":
   • Inspect the arguments (especially the one that should be an unsigned value, here "controllen") by using utility functions such as findSpecificTypeInChildren to detect any explicit CastExpr.
   • Check if that argument is being cast to int. You can detect a cast by looking at the AST node type (e.g., CStyleCastExpr) in the children of the argument expression.
   • To confirm that the cast relates to the problematic argument, use the provided utility function ExprHasName to check if the source text of the cast’s operand contains "controllen".

5. If an argument is found where "controllen" (or another unsigned variable) is first cast to int:
   • Generate a bug report with a short, clear message (for example, "Improper cast: variable 'controllen' cast to int for check_add_overflow call hides genuine overflow checks").
   • Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> to create and emit the bug report.

By following these steps in your checkPreCall implementation, you can catch the pattern where an unsigned size_t value is being cast to int in the overflow check, which may lead to missing genuine overflows.
