Your plan here

1. No need to customize program states for this checker because the bug pattern does not involve pointer aliasing or taint propagation.

2. Use the checkPreCall callback:
   • In checkPreCall, intercept all function calls.
   • Check if the callee’s identifier is “check_add_overflow”. You can do this by comparing Call.getCalleeIdentifier()->getName() with "check_add_overflow".

3. Analyze the call arguments:
   • Retrieve the argument expressions passed to check_add_overflow. In our target patch the bug was that one or both of these arguments were cast from an unsigned type (such as size_t) to int.
   • For each argument, use the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren (templated for a CastExpr or equivalent AST node type) to search for any cast expressions within the argument.

4. Inspect the cast:
   • For every cast expression found, check that the cast’s destination type is int.
   • Then, inspect the operand (child) of the cast to determine if its original type is unsigned (for example, size_t). You may use the AST’s type information APIs to compare these types.
   • If the cast is indeed converting an unsigned type to int, then this is a potential bug.

5. Report the bug:
   • When such a cast is detected in an argument passed to check_add_overflow, generate a bug report with a short, clear message (e.g., "Casting unsigned to int in check_add_overflow may mask overflow.").
   • Create a non-fatal error node and emit the bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>.

By following these steps, you can implement a checker that directly targets cases where a cast from an unsigned value (like size_t) to int is applied before calling check_add_overflow, which can lead to an integer underflow.
