----------------

1. No additional program state maps are needed for this checker since the detection only involves a local arithmetic subtraction and its surrounding conditional context.

2. Use the callback function checkPreStmt to detect the subtraction operation. In this callback, inspect each CompoundAssignOperator (or BinaryOperator if applicable) statement that performs a subtraction assignment. Specifically:

   • Check if the left-hand side is a MemberExpr accessing a field named "count" on an "iter" object (typically of type iov_iter).

3. Analyze the subtraction’s right-hand side expression. Verify that it involves an arithmetic operation where “shorten” is computed via iov_iter_count(iter) minus round_up(ret, block_bytes(...)). Use EvaluateExprToInt when possible to evaluate constant expressions for a better match.

4. Check the surrounding control flow:
   
   • Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to search upward in the AST from the subtraction statement.
   • Look for an enclosing IfStmt that performs a comparison between the computed "shorten" and "iter->count" (i.e. a condition like “if (shorten >= iter->count)”).
   • If such an if-statement is present, consider the subtraction as being properly guarded. Otherwise, it is unsafe and may lead to an unsigned underflow.

5. Reporting:
   
   • If the subtraction lacks the safety check, report the bug by emitting a short and clear diagnostic message (for example, "Possible unsigned underflow in iter->count subtraction").
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to generate the bug report and then call C.emitReport(...) to issue the diagnostic.

This step-by-step plan leverages a single callback (checkPreStmt) to detect the subtraction, uses upward AST inspection (findSpecificTypeInParents) to check for a guarding if-statement, and emits a concise bug report when the pattern is detected.
