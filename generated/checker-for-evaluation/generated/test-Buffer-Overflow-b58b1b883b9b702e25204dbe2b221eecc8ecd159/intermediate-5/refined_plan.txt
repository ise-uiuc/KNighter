1. Use no customized program state maps since this bug pattern can be detected by a syntactic AST pattern rather than any alias or value propagation.

2. Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept subtraction operations in the function. Specifically, look for subtraction-assignment operators (“-=”) where the left-hand side is the “count” field of an “iter” structure and the right-hand side is a computed variable (e.g. “shorten”).

 a. In checkPreStmt, filter for BinaryOperator nodes using the “-=” operator.

 b. Use utility functions (like ExprHasName) to check if the left-hand side’s source text contains “iter->count” and if the right-hand side’s text contains “shorten”. This confirms the pattern of subtracting “shorten” from iter->count.

3. Search upward in the AST tree from the subtraction assignment using findSpecificTypeInParents for an IfStmt node. This is to check if there is a conditional branch that verifies that “shorten” is less than iter->count prior to subtraction.

 a. If such a check is found (for example, an if condition containing “shorten >= iter->count”), then assume the subtraction is safe and do nothing.

 b. If no such check is found, then a potential unsigned underflow exists.

4. Report the issue using a concise bug report. Create a BasicBugReport (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a short message like “Underflow risk: unchecked subtraction may cause iter->count to underflow” and emit this warning.

By following these steps, you will identify the bug pattern of subtracting a computed length from a counter without the necessary precondition check to prevent underflow.
