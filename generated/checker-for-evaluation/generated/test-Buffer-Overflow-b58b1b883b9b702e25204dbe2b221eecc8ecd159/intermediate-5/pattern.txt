## Bug Pattern

Subtracting a computed length from a counter without verifying that the computed value is less than the counter can lead to an underflow. In this case, subtracting "shorten" from iter->count may underflow if shorten is equal to or exceeds iter->count, so the root cause is an unchecked subtraction of a potentially oversized value leading to an unsigned integer wraparound.
