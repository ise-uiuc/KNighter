1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • We do not need to introduce new program state maps because this checker does not track pointer aliasing or tainting; it only needs to verify that a subtraction on an unsigned integer is guarded against underflow.

2. Choose the callback function:
   • Use the checkASTCodeBody callback to traverse the function bodies and inspect their AST.
   • Optionally, use findSpecificTypeInParents when examining a “-=” binary operator to see if an appropriate guarding if-statement exists.

3. Implementation steps in checkASTCodeBody:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, iterate through the function’s AST and look for BinaryOperator nodes.
   • Identify BinaryOperator nodes with the compound-subtraction (“-=”) operator.
   • For each such operator, check the left-hand side of the assignment. Use the utility ExprHasName function (or similar manual AST inspection) to determine if it is an access of “iter->count.”
   • Similarly, inspect the right-hand side of the operator and check if it involves the “shorten” variable (for example, by confirming that its source text contains “shorten”). This identifies that the subtraction subtracts a computed “shorten” value from iter->count.

4. Check for guard conditions:
   • For each candidate subtraction, use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to search the AST upward from the BinaryOperator node for an enclosing if-statement.
   • Once an if-statement is found, inspect its condition (using ExprHasName or by manual inspection) to see if it compares “shorten” with “iter->count” (e.g. “if (shorten >= iter->count)” or similar).
   • If an appropriate guard is found, then this subtraction is safe; otherwise, proceed to report the bug.

5. Report the bug:
   • If no guarding check is found that ensures “shorten” is less than iter->count, generate a bug report.
   • The report message should be short and clear (for example, “Unchecked subtraction on iter->count may underflow”).
   • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> to create the bug report node and issue the warning.

6. Summary of callback implementation:
   • In checkASTCodeBody, iterate over all statements and filter for compound subtraction (“-=”).
   • For each candidate, check if the LHS accesses iter->count and the RHS uses the “shorten” variable.
   • Use findSpecificTypeInParents to see if a guarding if-statement exists (its condition should reference both “shorten” and “iter->count”).
   • If no guard is detected, report the potential underflow error.

Following these detailed yet straightforward steps will help you write a checker that detects the unchecked subtraction pattern and alerts the user if the subtraction might underflow the iter count.
