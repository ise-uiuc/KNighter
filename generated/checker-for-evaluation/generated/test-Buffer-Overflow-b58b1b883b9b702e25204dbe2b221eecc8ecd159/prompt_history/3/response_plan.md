1. Customize Program States:
   • In this checker no complex pointer aliasing or taint tracking is required. Therefore, you do not need to register a custom program state.

2. Choose Callback Function – checkPostStmt on Assignment/Compound Operator:
   • Use the checkPostStmt callback to catch assignment or compound assignment (i.e. “-=”) statements.
   • In the callback, filter the visited statement to detect a compound subtraction assignment where the left-hand side is the “count” member of an iov_iter structure. (You can check if the LHS expression’s source text contains "iter->count" using ExprHasName.)
   • Also verify that the right-hand side is a computed value that involves subtracting the rounded‐up size (using the “round_up” function) from the original iov_iter_count(iter). You can check these by scanning for embedded function names in the RHS expression (i.e. using ExprHasName for "iov_iter_count" and "round_up").

3. Check for a Safe-Guarding Branch:
   • Use the utility function findSpecificTypeInParents to walk upward from the subtraction statement to see if there is an enclosing if-statement.
   • In that if-statement, use ExprHasName to verify that the branch’s condition checks that the value being subtracted (i.e. “shorten”) is not greater than or equal to iter->count (for example, by checking if the condition text contains both "shorten" and "iter->count" or “>=”).
   • If such a branch exists, then the subtraction is safe.

4. Report the Warning:
   • If no protective condition is found (i.e. if the subtraction is performed without first checking that shorten is less than iter->count), then generate a bug report using BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport.
   • The report message should be concise, for example: "Possible underflow: iter->count subtraction without safe-check."
   • Emit the report using the CheckerContext’s report interface.

5. Summary of the Implementation Steps:
   • In checkPostStmt, intercept the subtraction assignment statement.
   • Confirm the pattern: the LHS is "iter->count" and the RHS is computed as (iov_iter_count(iter) – round_up(...)).
   • Use findSpecificTypeInParents to look for a prior if-statement that verifies “if (shorten >= iter->count)” or an equivalent safe-check.
   • If the safe-check is missing, report the bug.

This concise plan leverages our utility functions (ExprHasName and findSpecificTypeInParents) and uses checkPostStmt to monitor arithmetic operations. Follow these concrete steps to write a correct and straightforward checker.
