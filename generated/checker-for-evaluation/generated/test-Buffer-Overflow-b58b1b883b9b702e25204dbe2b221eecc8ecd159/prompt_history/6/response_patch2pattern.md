## Bug Pattern

Subtracting a computed adjustment from a size counter without validating that the subtraction won't exceed the current count. In this case, failing to ensure that "shorten" is less than "iter->count" leads to an underflow of the iov_iter count when reducing it, which can trigger a crash or other erroneous behavior.
