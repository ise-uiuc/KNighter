1. Decide if it is necessary to customize program states:
   • No custom program state is needed since we only need to check a particular subtraction expression and its guarding condition within one function body (bch2_direct_IO_read). No alias or taint tracking is required.

2. Choose callback functions and implement each step as follows:
   • In checkPreStmt:
     – Intercept compound assignment statements. In particular, look for a BinaryOperator (or CompoundAssignOperator) with “-=” which modifies iter->count.
     – Verify that the left-hand side expression is indeed “iter->count” by using utilities such as ExprHasName to check if the source text contains "iter->count".
     – For the right-hand side operand (the subtract argument), identify that it is computed as “iov_iter_count(iter) - round_up(ret, block_bytes(c))”.
     – If this subtraction is found, your checker should attempt to determine if there is a guard. Use the helper function findSpecificTypeInParents<IfStmt> on the subtraction expression.

   • In checkBranchCondition:
     – When an if-statement is visited, inspect its condition to see if it contains a comparison between the computed “shorten” value and “iter->count” (i.e. an expression comparing if (shorten >= iter->count)). You can use ExprHasName to check if both “shorten” and “iter->count” appear in the condition.
     – Record the fact that a guarding check is in place (e.g., by marking the checked region in a local variable or a simple flag stored in the program state if needed). For a simple checker, you may just detect that such an if-statement exists in the parent nodes of the subtraction.

   • In checkPreStmt (continuation):
     – When handling the subtraction from iter->count, first try to see if its parent (or nearby control flow) has performed the guard check using the information from your checkBranchCondition or by scanning the parent nodes with findSpecificTypeInParents.
     – If no such guard is found (i.e. if there is no if-statement checking “if (shorten >= iter->count)”), then report a bug.
     – Report a bug using a basic BugReport with a short message such as "Underflow risk: subtraction from iter->count without proper bound check" by creating a BasicBugReport (or PathSensitiveBugReport) and emitting it via the bug reporter.

3. Summary of Steps:
   1. In checkPreStmt, intercept compound assignment expressions (using a BinaryOperator callback) and filter those where LHS is “iter->count”.
   2. Analyze the RHS expression to confirm it is computed as the difference between iov_iter_count(iter) and round_up(...). This confirms the target pattern.
   3. Traverse upward (or check branch conditions via checkBranchCondition) to determine if a guard condition “if (shorten >= iter->count)” exists.
   4. If no guarding condition is detected, issue a bug report with a concise message.

This plan uses the provided utility functions (e.g., findSpecificTypeInParents and ExprHasName) to detect the relevant AST nodes and conditions. It also uses checkPreStmt and checkBranchCondition callbacks to make sure the subtraction operation is properly guarded.
