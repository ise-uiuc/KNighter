1. Customize a Program State Map:
   • Define a map using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(CheckedCountMap, const MemRegion*, bool) to record whether a given iter->count has been verified against an underflow condition.

2. Identify the Underflow-Prone Assignment:
   • In the checkPreStmt callback, look for a subtraction assignment (compound operator “-=”) where the left-hand side is the “count” field of an iov_iter.
   • Use AST helpers (e.g., findSpecificTypeInChildren to navigate to a MemberExpr) to confirm that the field being modified is “count.”
   • Retrieve the memory region associated with iter->count using getMemRegionFromExpr.

3. Verify Safe Guarding of the Subtraction:
   • In checkPreStmt, when a subtraction assignment is detected, query the CheckedCountMap for the iter->count region.
   • If the region is not marked as checked (i.e. the map does not record a true flag for this region), then report a bug with a concise message (e.g. “Underflow risk: adjustment may exceed count.”) using a bug report builder like std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>.

4. Hook the Branch Condition Verification:
   • In the checkBranchCondition callback, inspect branch conditions that compare the computed “shorten” value and iter->count.
   • Look for a binary comparison with operator >= where one operand comes from a “shorten” computed by functions such as round_up (or a variable with that name) and the other is iter->count.
   • If such a condition is found, obtain the memory region for iter->count and update the CheckedCountMap to mark that region as safe (set the mapping to true). This indicates that before the subtraction, the code verified that shorten is less than iter->count.

5. Tracking the Data Flow:
   • Although pointer aliasing is not critical here, if needed you may define a PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) to track any aliasing of iter->count. This ensures that the check applies even if iter->count is indirectly updated.
   • In checkBind, update the PtrAliasMap when one pointer is assigned from another. Then, in both checkBranchCondition and checkPreStmt, ensure that if one alias is marked as safe, all aliases reflect that update.

Following these concrete steps ensures you model the computed adjustment and verify its safety before subtraction. This minimal and focused plan leverages checkBranchCondition to catch proper guard conditions and checkPreStmt to detect the dangerous subtraction, with state maps to track when the branch condition was present.
