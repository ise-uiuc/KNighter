Your plan here

1. Decide if it’s necessary to customize program states:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(NumTripsInitMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will track whether the “num_trips” field (the size indicator) has been assigned (true) or not (false).  
   • No pointer‐alias map is needed because we are focusing on the assignment of a specific field.

2. Choose callback functions:

   • checkBind:
     – In checkBind, intercept assignments.
     – Inspect the left-hand side and, by using, for example, ExprHasName (or by checking if it is a MemberExpr) determine if the binding is to the “num_trips” field.
     – Once that field is found (e.g. “tz->num_trips”) call getMemRegionFromExpr to retrieve its memory region.
     – Update the NumTripsInitMap in the current ProgramState to mark that region as initialized (set flag to true).

   • checkPreCall:
     – In checkPreCall, intercept all call events.
     – Identify the memcpy() calls – for instance, using the callee identifier (or using ExprHasName to compare the source text with “memcpy”).
     – Confirm that the memcpy call is within the function thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips (this can be done by checking if the function’s name in the AST matches, or by storing the function name in checkBeginFunction).
     – Analyze the memcpy arguments to ensure that the “size” argument depends on the “num_trips” variable.
       ▪ Optionally use EvaluateExprToInt on the size expression to see if the computed element count reflects an uninitialized value.
       ▪ Alternatively, retrieve the underlying MemRegion corresponding to the “num_trips” variable (using a helper like getMemRegionFromExpr if its use is transparently available) so that you can lookup the NumTripsInitMap.
     – If the lookup in NumTripsInitMap does not show that the “num_trips” field has been set yet, then generate a warning: the memcpy is using an uninitialized size indicator.
       ▪ Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) with a short, clear message such as “memcpy call uses uninitialized size indicator”.

   • (Optional) checkBeginFunction / checkEndFunction:
     – In checkBeginFunction, if you wish, record that you are processing thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips. This helps limit the scope of the checker to the function of interest.
     – In checkEndFunction or checkEndAnalysis, you can clear any state if needed.

3. Summary of the implementation steps:

   Step 1: Customize Program State
     – REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(NumTripsInitMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – When entering thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips, no “num_trips” field is marked as initialized.

   Step 2: Implement checkBind Callback
     – For each binding, determine whether the left-hand side is “num_trips” (e.g. by inspecting the MemberExpr’s name).
     – Retrieve its MemRegion and update the state: set NumTripsInitMap[Region] = true.

   Step 3: Implement checkPreCall Callback for memcpy
     – On every memcpy call, verify that it is located inside thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips.
     – Extract the size parameter of memcpy and, if possible, determine if this uses the “num_trips” value.
     – Use the recorded program state (NumTripsInitMap) to check if “num_trips” has been initialized.
     – If not initialized, report the bug with a clear message.

By following these steps you will be able to detect the ordering bug where memcpy() is called before the size indicator is set.
