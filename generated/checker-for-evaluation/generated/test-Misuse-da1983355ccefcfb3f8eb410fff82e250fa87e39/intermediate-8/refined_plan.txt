1. No custom program state maps are required.
   • Since this checker only needs to analyze the ordering of two statements within a specific function, no alias or taint tracking is necessary.

2. Choose the callback function:
   • Use the checkASTCodeBody callback to analyze the function body of thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips.

3. Implementation steps in checkASTCodeBody:
   a. Identify the function:
      • Check if the FunctionDecl’s name is "thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips".
   b. Traverse the function body:
      • Walk through the body’s AST (e.g., using an AST visitor) to locate:
         - The memcpy call that copies data into tz->trips.
         - The assignment statement that sets tz->num_trips.
   c. Record Source Locations:
      • For each statement found, record its SourceLocation (or ordering based on traversal order).
   d. Check ordering:
      • Verify that the assignment to tz->num_trips occurs before the memcpy call.
      • If the memcpy call appears before the num_trips assignment, the checker should report a bug.
   e. Report the bug:
      • Generate a bug report with a short, clear message (e.g., “Misordered initialization: num_trips set after memcpy”)
      • Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) to create and emit the report.

4. Extra details:
   • Use utility functions like findSpecificTypeInChildren, if helpful, to locate the memcpy call and the binary assignment statement.
   • Compare the source text using the SourceManager if needed to ensure the correct member (e.g., that the assignment is to tz->num_trips).
   • Ensure that the checker only runs for the thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips function to avoid false positives.

Follow these steps to implement a clear and concise checker that detects when the memcpy operation is performed before the proper initialization of the size field used in fortify checks.
