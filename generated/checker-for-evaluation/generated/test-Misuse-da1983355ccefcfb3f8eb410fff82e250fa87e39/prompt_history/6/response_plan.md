1. Customize Program State:
   • REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(TripAssignedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
     – This map will record, keyed by the memory region for the thermal_zone_device structure (or directly its “num_trips” field), whether the “num_trips” field has been assigned a non‐default value.
   • (Optionally) REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*) if you want to track aliases of the pointer (but this is not strictly necessary if you limit analysis to the current function body).

2. Choose Callback Functions:

   a) checkBind Callback:
      • When a value is bound to a memory location, examine whether the left-hand side expression is a member expression accessing “num_trips.”
      • Use the AST helper (e.g., finding a MemberExpr with name “num_trips” in the LHS) to determine if this bind statement is an assignment to num_trips.
      • If yes, extract the corresponding MemRegion (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and mark it in TripAssignedMap as true.
      • This ensures that when the assignment to num_trips occurs, its state is recorded.

   b) checkPostCall Callback:
      • Intercept call events. Check whether the call is to memcpy.
      • For calls to memcpy, retrieve the destination argument (which should be tz->trips in this case).
      • Use the AST upward utility (findSpecificTypeInParents) from the destination expression to locate the instance of the thermal_zone_device structure.
      • Once the structure is determined, use getMemRegionFromExpr to get its region and consult TripAssignedMap.
      • If the record indicates that “num_trips” has not yet been assigned (or the mapping is missing/false), report an initialization order error.
      • Generate a short, clear bug report using std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> (or PathSensitiveBugReport) with a message such as: "Initialization order error: num_trips is updated after memcpy, causing fortify check to compute zero buffer size."

3. Summary:
   • In checkBind, every time “tz->num_trips” is assigned, record the assignment in TripAssignedMap.
   • In checkPostCall, detect memcpy calls in thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips. Check that if the destination involves tz->trips then the corresponding trace (via the parent structure’s region) has “num_trips” assigned.
   • If not, trigger a report indicating the ordering error.
   
This plan uses the simplest steps: collecting an assignment state via checkBind and validating it via checkPostCall when encountering memcpy. This design is concrete and follows the suggestions with minimal complexity while ensuring correct detection of the bug pattern.
