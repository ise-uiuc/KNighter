Your plan here

1. Identify the Target Function:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, check if the FunctionDecl’s name is "thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips". This ensures we only analyze the function where the bug pattern is present.

2. Traverse the Function Body:
   • In the body of the function, iterate over the compound statement’s children.
   • Look for two specific statements:
     - A memcpy() call: Identify a CallExpr with callee name "memcpy".
     - An assignment of the buffer size: Look for a BinaryOperator (assignment) where the left-hand side is a MemberExpr referencing the structure field (e.g. "num_trips"). You can check that the member name contains "num_trips" using getNameAsString().

3. Check Statement Ordering:
   • Record the SourceLocation of the memcpy() call (e.g. its beginning location) and the SourceLocation of the assignment to the count field.
   • Compare these locations:
     - If the assignment occurs after the memcpy() call, it indicates that the memory copy is performed before the buffer size is set.
     - This misordering triggers the bug pattern because __counted_by()-based fortify checks will interpret the buffer as size zero.
     
4. Report the Bug:
   • If the ordering is incorrect (i.e. memcpy comes before the count assignment), generate a bug report.
   • Use a short message such as "Buffer size assigned after memcpy" and report the issue with std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>.

5. (Optional) Use Utility Functions for AST Traversal:
   • To help locate the relevant statements, you may use utility functions like findSpecificTypeInChildren to get child statements of a CompoundStmt.
   • Use getNameAsString() to ensure you are matching the target member name.

6. No Custom Program States Needed:
   • Since this bug pattern does not require tracking pointer aliases or taint, there is no need to REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE.
   • The analysis is wholly syntactic and based on SourceLocation ordering.

By following these concrete steps in the checkASTCodeBody callback, you can easily implement a checker that detects when a structure field (defining buffer size) is assigned after its dependent memcpy() operation, causing the fortify check to misinterpret the buffer size.
