Your plan should be structured as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Customized Program States

• Use a program state map to track if the “num_trips” field has been assigned for a given thermal_zone_device instance.

  - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(AssignedNumTripsMap, const MemRegion*, bool)

  • The key will be the memory region for the “tz” instance (obtained via the base pointer in the “num_trips” assignment).
  • The value will be a flag (true when “num_trips” has been assigned).

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose and Implement Callback Functions

a. checkBind
   • Objective: Detect when the “num_trips” field is assigned.
   • Implementation Steps:
     - In checkBind, examine the LHS of the binding.
     - If the LHS is a MemberExpr whose member name is “num_trips”, then use getMemRegionFromExpr() (or similar) to retrieve the base object’s region.
     - Update the AssignedNumTripsMap in the program state to flag that the instance’s “num_trips” field is now assigned.
     - (Optionally track aliasing via a PtrAliasMap if needed; however, for this simple checker tracking the base “tz” instance is enough.)

b. checkPreCall
   • Objective: Detect calls to memcpy() where the destination is “tz->trips” and ensure that “num_trips” was assigned beforehand.
   • Implementation Steps:
     - Intercept function calls in checkPreCall.
     - First, check that the callee’s name is “memcpy” (using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and comparing with "memcpy").
     - Retrieve the destination argument of memcpy – use the utility function or examine the AST to see if it is a MemberExpr accessing “trips”.
     - If the destination is “tz->trips”, then use the associated base object (the “tz” pointer) and obtain its MemRegion.
     - Query the AssignedNumTripsMap from the program state. If the flag for that region is not set (i.e. “num_trips” has not been assigned yet), then generate a bug report.
     - The bug report should be short and clear (for example: "memcpy called before num_trips assignment").

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Bug Reporting

• When emitting the bug report from checkPreCall:
   - Use std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> with the brief message.
   - Create a non-fatal error node to flag the issue.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary of the Checker Flow

• Upon entering thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips, the program state for AssignedNumTripsMap is “empty” (or defaults to false for any encountered “tz” instance).

• As the function body is processed, checkBind detects the assignment “tz->num_trips = num_trips” and updates the map for the corresponding tz region.

• Later, when a memcpy call is processed in checkPreCall, if its destination is identified as “tz->trips”, then the checker retrieves the base “tz” object region and verifies whether “num_trips” has been set.
   - If not set, the checker reports the bug hinting at incorrect operation order.

------------------------------------------------------------
This concise plan uses a customized program state to track a single field assignment and two callbacks – checkBind (to mark the assignment) and checkPreCall (to check correct ordering before fortified memcpy) – to achieve the goal with minimal and clear steps.
