1. Register a custom program state flag:
   • Use REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(NumTripsAssigned, bool) to record whether the “num_trips” field has been initialized.
   • By default, the flag for each function (or more specifically for thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips) is false.

2. Track the assignment to “num_trips” in checkBind:
   • In the checkBind callback, inspect the binding event to see if the left-hand side expression is a field access (MemberExpr) representing “num_trips.”
   • Use ExprHasName on the LHS expression to check if its source text contains “num_trips.”
   • If the check succeeds, update the program state flag NumTripsAssigned to true.
   • Also update any alias information using a PtrAliasMap if needed, so that subsequent assignments or checks recognize the update.

3. Hook memcpy call via checkPreCall:
   • In the checkPreCall callback, intercept CallEvent events.
   • Check if the callee name is “memcpy” and that the call occurs inside thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips by using findSpecificTypeInParents or examining the context function name.
   • Retrieve the current program state (flag NumTripsAssigned) for the current context.
   • If the flag is still false (indicating that “num_trips” has not been assigned prior to this memcpy), then report the bug.
   • Emit a bug report with a short message such as “Memcpy executed before num_trips is initialized.”
   • Use generateNonFatalErrorNode and create a PathSensitiveBugReport or BasicBugReport to report the issue.

4. Summary of callbacks:
   • checkBind: Detect assignments to the “num_trips” field and update NumTripsAssigned in the program state.
   • checkPreCall: Detect memcpy calls and check the NumTripsAssigned flag; if false, trigger the bug report.
   • No additional callbacks or state tracking is necessary since the order can be determined by observing the update of the flag in checkBind and the memcpy call in checkPreCall.

This plan provides a simple, step-by-step method to track the order-of-initialization issue for the “num_trips” field and to report a potential buffer overflow due to incorrect ordering.
