Your plan is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Customize Program State

• Use a program state map to track whether the structure’s count field (num_trips) has been set. For example, register a map using  
 REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(NumTripsInitMap, const MemRegion*, bool)

• The key will be the memory region for the thermal_zone_device structure (tz). The mapped value is true if num_trips has been assigned, or false otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions

A. Use checkBind to Track Assignments to num_trips  
 • In checkBind, inspect the left-hand side of every assignment.  
 • When you see an assignment to the field “num_trips” (e.g. via an expression like tz->num_trips = …), extract the memory region for the containing structure (tz).  
 • Update the NumTripsInitMap to record that tz has had its num_trips initialized (set the flag to true).  
 • Also consider aliasing: if another pointer is bound to tz, use a separate PtrAliasMap (if needed) so that any alias gets marked as having a checked initialization.

B. Use checkPostCall to Intercept memcpy  
 • In checkPostCall, look for calls to memcpy.  
 • Retrieve the call’s destination parameter (the memory being written) and try to determine if it comes from a member (e.g. trips) of the thermal_zone_device structure.  
 • Use a helper like findSpecificTypeInParents to walk from the destination expression upward to identify the containing structure (tz).  
 • For that structure region, consult NumTripsInitMap. If the flag for tz is false (or not present), then the memcpy is occurring before num_trips has been set.  
 • In that case, report a bug using a short, clear message (for example, “Initialization order error: num_trips not set before memcpy”).

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Details in Each Callback

• In checkBind:
 – Check if the LHS is a member expression referring to “num_trips”.  
 – If so, obtain the base (tz) from the LHS (you can rely on AST utilities/dyn_cast for MemberExpr).  
 – Retrieve the associated memory region (using getMemRegionFromExpr) and mark it in NumTripsInitMap as initialized.

• In checkPostCall:
 – When a memcpy call is detected, retrieve the first argument which is the destination.  
 – Use getMemRegionFromExpr to determine the region corresponding to tz->trips.  
 – Then use findSpecificTypeInParents (or another AST-walking approach) to get the parent region that represents the complete structure (tz).  
 – Consult the NumTripsInitMap for that tz region.  
 – If the flag is missing or false, generate a bug report using a concise message.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. Reporting

• Use a bug report creation helper such as std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> with a short message.  
• The report should indicate that “num_trips not set before memcpy” and highlight the initialization order error.

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary

Your checker will track the initialization status of the num_trips field using a program state map (NumTripsInitMap) updated in checkBind. Then, when memcpy is called, checkPostCall will verify that the pointer’s containing structure has its num_trips set. If not, report the bug. This approach adheres to a clean, minimal design with precise callbacks to detect the initialization order issue.
