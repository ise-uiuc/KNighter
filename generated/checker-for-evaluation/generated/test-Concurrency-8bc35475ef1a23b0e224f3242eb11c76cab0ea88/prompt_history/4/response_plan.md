Your plan is as follows:

─────────────────────────────  
1. Decide on Program State  
─────────────────────────────  
• No custom program state maps are needed. We only need to detect the ordering of operations in the function body.

─────────────────────────────  
2. Choose Callback: checkBranchCondition  
─────────────────────────────  
• In the checkBranchCondition callback, intercept every branch (if) condition.  
• Use the utility function ExprHasName to check if the condition’s source text contains the string "from_cancel".  
• If “from_cancel” is present in the condition, it indicates that the function is checking whether the work flush is coming from cancellation.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Locate Prior Read of Work Data  
─────────────────────────────  
• Once you have found an if-condition that checks “from_cancel”, use the helper findSpecificTypeInParents (with the template parameter set to CompoundStmt) to retrieve the enclosing block, or use your own technique to get the parent compound statement.  
• Iterate over the statements in that compound statement that occur before the if-condition.  
• For each statement, use the utility function ExprHasName (or get the source text via Lexer::getSourceText) to check whether it contains the substring "work_data_bits". This call represents the unguarded read of the shared work data.  
• To keep things simple, you can inspect the source text of each statement—if one of them includes "work_data_bits", then it is likely that the unconditionally performed read occurs before the condition check.

─────────────────────────────  
4. Report the Issue  
─────────────────────────────  
• If you detect that a statement reading work data (via work_data_bits) precedes the branch testing “from_cancel”, generate a bug report.  
• Use a short message (for example: "Premature read of work data before cancellation check").  
• Create and emit the bug report using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> (or BasicBugReport) and report via the CheckerContext.

─────────────────────────────  
5. Summary  
─────────────────────────────  
• In checkBranchCondition, scan the if-condition for the "from_cancel" flag.  
• Retrieve the enclosing compound statement (block) and examine all prior statements to see if any statement calls work_data_bits.  
• When such an ordering is found, report a bug indicating that the data was accessed before the cancellation check (i.e. before confirming from_cancel).  

This concise plan uses the simplest approach by leveraging the branch condition callback with source text analysis (via utility function ExprHasName) without the need for custom program states or pointer aliasing tracking.
