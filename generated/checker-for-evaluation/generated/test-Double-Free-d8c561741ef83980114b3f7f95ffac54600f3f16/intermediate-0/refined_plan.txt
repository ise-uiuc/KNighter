Your plan is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------
1. Decide on Customized Program States

• No extra program states or alias maps are needed for this checker.  
  This bug pattern is fully identified by checking that in the function hws_send_ring_create_sq (or in its error‐handling code) the wrong cleanup routine (hws_send_ring_close_sq) is used.  
  Therefore, you can avoid the overhead of tracking pointer aliases or allocated regions.

----------------------------------------------------------
2. Choose Callback Functions and Their Implementation Details

A. Use checkASTCodeBody Callback  
 • In checkASTCodeBody, inspect the body of every function declaration.  
 • If the function’s name is “hws_send_ring_create_sq”, traverse its statement body to detect any call to “hws_send_ring_close_sq”.  
  – Use a helper function (or the utility function findSpecificTypeInChildren) to walk the AST nodes in the function body.  
  – For every call-expression node encountered, use ExprHasName or compare the callee’s identifier (getNameAsString()) against "hws_send_ring_close_sq".  
 • If you find such a call, report a bug by generating a nonfatal error node and emitting a bug report (e.g. via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>).  
 • The bug report message should be short and clear (for instance: "Double free: Incorrect cleanup function used in error path").

B. (Optional Alternative) Use checkPreCall Callback  
 • Instead of the full AST traversal, you could intercept each call event in checkPreCall.  
 • Inside checkPreCall, if the callee’s name equals "hws_send_ring_close_sq", then use findSpecificTypeInParents to determine if this call is occurring within the body of hws_send_ring_create_sq.  
 • If the call is located inside the error path of hws_send_ring_create_sq (or at least within that function’s scope), issue the bug report as above.  
 • This method is simpler if you can easily resolve the parent function context; however, the checkASTCodeBody approach is more straightforward for this static pattern.

----------------------------------------------------------
3. Reporting the Bug

 • In the callback where the issue is detected, generate a bug report node (using std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> or std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>) with a short message such as “Incorrect cleanup: hws_send_ring_close_sq() may lead to double free”.  
 • Emit the report using the CheckerContext’s emitReport interface.

----------------------------------------------------------
4. Summary of Steps

 1. In checkASTCodeBody, check if the current function’s name is “hws_send_ring_create_sq”.  
 2. Traverse its body (e.g. using recursive visitation with findSpecificTypeInChildren) to look for call expressions whose source text (or callee name) equals “hws_send_ring_close_sq”.  
 3. When such a call is found, immediately create and emit a bug report indicating that the wrong cleanup function is used and it might lead to a double-free issue.  
 4. (Alternatively, intercept cleanup calls in checkPreCall and use the parent context to decide if the call belongs to hws_send_ring_create_sq’s error flow.)

----------------------------------------------------------
This concise plan is sufficient to implement a checker that detects the use of an incorrect cleanup function in the error path, leading potentially to double free.

Your next step is to write the checker code following this design.
