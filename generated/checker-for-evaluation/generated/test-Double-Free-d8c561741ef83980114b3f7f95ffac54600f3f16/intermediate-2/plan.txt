Your plan here

1. Decide on customizing program states:
   • No new program state maps or alias tracking is needed because the bug is identified through the use of an incorrect cleanup function call during error handling. We simply need to detect if the wrong cleanup function is invoked.

2. Choose callback functions:
   • Use the checkPreCall callback to intercept function calls. This will allow us to inspect every call event as it occurs.
   • (Optional) You could use checkASTDecl or checkASTCodeBody to limit the analysis to functions of interest (e.g. hws_send_ring_create_sq_rdy), but the simplest approach is to focus on the cleanup function itself in checkPreCall.

3. Implementing the checkPreCall callback:
   • In checkPreCall, retrieve the callee name from the CallEvent. Use the provided utility function ExprHasName if needed to confirm the call’s textual name.
   • Check if the callee’s name equals "hws_send_ring_close_sq". This is the cleanup function that is wrongly used in an error path.
   • If the condition is met, create a bug report with a short and clear message such as "Double-free error: wrong cleanup function 'hws_send_ring_close_sq' used in error path".
   • Report this bug using the appropriate bug reporting mechanism (for example, creating a BasicBugReport via std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>).

4. Further clarifications:
   • Do not confuse this checker with pointer or taint analysis checkers. The bug exclusively concerns cleanup function misuse. Therefore, no program state modification (like REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE for pointers or proper alias mapping) is necessary.
   • The focus is on detecting the use of a cleanup function (hws_send_ring_close_sq) when an error occurs. You can further constrain the detector by checking if the call site is in an error-handling branch (e.g., situated under a check on the return value) by using the Ancestor lookup using the provided findSpecificTypeInParents template function. However, even without that extra step, detecting the call by name should be simple and effective.

This simple, step-by-step approach will enable you to write a checker that reports the bug pattern as described, ensuring the error path uses the proper cleanup function (hws_send_ring_destroy_sq) instead of hws_send_ring_close_sq.
