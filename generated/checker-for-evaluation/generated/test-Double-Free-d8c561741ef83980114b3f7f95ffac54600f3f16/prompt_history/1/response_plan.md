Your plan is as follows:

1. Decide if customization of program states is needed:  
   • Use a program state map (e.g. REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(SQStateMap, const MemRegion*, bool)) that associates the memory region for the SQ (or its primary member that indicates allocation) with a boolean indicating whether the SQ has been freed using the proper destroy function.  
   • Optionally, add a PtrAliasMap (REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)) to track aliases if the SQ pointer is assigned to other variables.

2. Choose callback functions and implement steps:

   a. In checkPostCall:  
      • Intercept calls to the function that allocates an SQ (for example, hws_send_ring_create_sq).  
      • Retrieve the allocated SQ’s MemRegion (e.g. from one of its members or from the return expression if available) and record it in SQStateMap as “allocated and not freed” (mark with false indicating not yet freed by the correct function).  
      • Also record any aliasing using PtrAliasMap when a pointer to the SQ is bound to another variable (this can also be done in checkBind).

   b. In checkPreCall:  
      • Intercept the call event for cleanup functions.  
      • Check if the callee’s name is the incorrect cleanup function (e.g. “hws_send_ring_close_sq”).  
      • Retrieve the SQ pointer (using an utility function such as getMemRegionFromExpr on the cleanup call’s argument) and then use the program state map to look up its allocation status.  
      • If the SQ is still marked as allocated or if it was expected to be freed by using the destroy function, trigger a bug report indicating a “Double free” possibility.  
      • As an improvement, you could also flag an error if the cleanup function used is “hws_send_ring_close_sq”, suggesting that instead “hws_send_ring_destroy_sq” should be called.

   c. In checkBind (if pointer aliasing needs to be tracked):  
      • When a pointer assignment happens (e.g. p2 = p1), record the alias relationship in PtrAliasMap.  
      • Later, when a pointer is marked as freed or checked, update its aliases accordingly in the SQStateMap.

3. Bug Reporting:  
   • When the checker detects an invocation of the incorrect cleanup function (hws_send_ring_close_sq) in a context where the SQ region should be freed by the proper destroy function, create a non-fatal error node and emit a bug report using a simple message such as “Incorrect cleanup function: potential double free in SQ error path.”

Following these concrete steps using the provided utility functions and callbacks (checkPostCall, checkPreCall, checkBind), you will be able to write a clear and concise checker for detecting the bug pattern of using an incorrect cleanup function that causes double free.
