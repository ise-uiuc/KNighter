## Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is a double free issue where a memory resource (ca->buckets_nouse) is being freed twice. In the buggy code, ca->buckets_nouse is manually deallocated via kfree() while its cleanup is already handled by another function (likely bch2_dev_buckets_free()), resulting in a double free vulnerability.
