Your plan is as follows:

 1. Customize Program States  
  • Register a map (using REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) to track if a memory region has been freed already. For example, define a “DoubleFreeMap” that maps a pointer’s MemRegion to a boolean flag.  
  • Register a trait (using REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) to record whether bch2_dev_buckets_free has been called in the current function. Call this trait “BucketsFreeCalled” with a bool value.

 2. Choose Callback Functions and Define Their Behavior

  A. In checkPreCall  
   – For every call event, check if the callee is bch2_dev_buckets_free. If so, update the program state to set “BucketsFreeCalled” to true. (You can detect the call by checking Call.getCalleeIdentifier().)  
   – Also in checkPreCall, detect calls to kfree. When a call to kfree is encountered:
    • Use the utility function ExprHasName() on the kfree argument to see if it contains “buckets_nouse”.  
    • If it does, then retrieve the MemRegion corresponding to the argument by using getMemRegionFromExpr().  
    • Then, check the program state “DoubleFreeMap” for that region.  
     – If the region is already marked as freed or if “BucketsFreeCalled” is true (indicating that bch2_dev_buckets_free is also freeing that resource), report a bug with a clear, short message such as “Double free of buckets_nouse”.  
     – Otherwise, update the DoubleFreeMap to mark that region as freed.

  B. (Optional) In checkEndFunction  
   – For thoroughness, you may check at the end of the function if both a kfree call on buckets_nouse and a call to bch2_dev_buckets_free have been registered. If both are found, you may also emit a bug report. This serves as a final safeguard, but the main logic is implemented in checkPreCall.

 3. Summary of Implementation  
  • The checker will rely on two program state objects: one for tracking the freed state of buckets_nouse (DoubleFreeMap), and one for marking that bch2_dev_buckets_free has been called (BucketsFreeCalled).  
  • In checkPreCall, when encountering a kfree call, it will use the utility function ExprHasName to confirm the targeted field is “buckets_nouse” and then combine the state information.  
  • When a double free is detected (either because the region was already freed or because bch2_dev_buckets_free has been invoked to free the same resource), the checker will report a bug using a short, clear bug message.

Following this concrete plan will allow you to efficiently write a checker that detects the double free of ca->buckets_nouse in the target patch.
