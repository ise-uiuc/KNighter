1. Decide on Program State Customization:
   • No need to register custom program state maps (like REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE) for tracking variables or aliases because the issue can be detected by analyzing the AST structure of the loop’s condition.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use the checkPreStmt callback to intercept WhileStmt nodes.
   • Optionally, also inspect the surrounding AST via findSpecificTypeInParents to ensure the while loop is inside an error-handling branch (e.g. within an if-statement that checks an error result after a resource allocation loop).

3. Step-by-Step Implementation:

   (a) In checkPreStmt:
       • Check if the current statement is a WhileStmt.
       • Retrieve its condition and verify whether it is a BinaryOperator.
       • Confirm that the operator is a “>” operator.
       • Use the utility function getArraySizeFromExpr-like techniques (or directly inspect the AST) to identify if the left-hand side of the binary operator is a PreDecrement expression (i.e. --i).
       • Verify that the right-hand side expression evaluates to integer 0 (using EvaluateExprToInt).
       • Use ExprHasName to validate that the decremented variable is indeed the expected loop counter (e.g. “i”).
  
   (b) Additional Context Inspection:
       • Through findSpecificTypeInParents, ensure that the while loop is contained within an if-statement branch. This branch should originate from an error condition after a resource allocation loop.
       • If needed, check the function name to be “gsc_runtime_resume” or a similar pattern to further narrow down this bug pattern.

   (c) Detection and Reporting:
       • If all conditions are met (i.e. while loop condition is of the form “--i > 0”, ensuring that index 0 is not processed during cleanup), generate a bug report.
       • Use a short and clear message (e.g. “Off-by-one error: cleanup loop does not process the first resource.”) and report it by emitting a bug report with either BasicBugReport or PathSensitiveBugReport.
  
   (d) Finalize:
       • Ensure that the checker does not report false positives by making the condition check as specific as possible (verifying both the pre-decrement structure and the literal 0 comparison).
       • Avoid unnecessary program state tracking, keeping the implementation simple based solely on AST inspection.

Follow these steps while using the available utility functions for navigating the AST and evaluating expressions, thus ensuring a concise and correct checker implementation for this off-by-one resource cleanup bug.
