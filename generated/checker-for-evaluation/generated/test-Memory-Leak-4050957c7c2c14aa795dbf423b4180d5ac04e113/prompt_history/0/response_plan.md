1. Identify the target function:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, traverse each function declaration to locate the function containing the resource cleanup loop—in this case, the one with "gsc_runtime_resume".
   • Use the function name (via getNameAsString()) to narrow down the target.

2. Locate the error branch and cleanup loop:
   • Within the target function’s body, use AST traversal (or helper functions like findSpecificTypeInChildren) to locate the "if" statement that checks the return value after calling clk_prepare_enable.
   • In the "if" block, identify the cleanup loop, which is a while loop.

3. Analyze the while loop’s condition:
   • In the checkASTCodeBody callback, once the while loop is found, inspect its condition.
   • Check if the condition is a BinaryOperator comparing "--i" to the literal 0 using the ">" operator.
   • Verify that the left-hand side of the condition is a prefix unary operator (e.g. --i) and the right-hand side is the integer literal 0.

4. Detect the bug pattern:
   • If the condition is "--i > 0", then it is a bug because it fails to include the 0th index.
   • The correct condition should be "--i >= 0". So, when the operator is strictly ">", this pattern is identified as a bug.

5. Report the bug:
   • Create a bug report with a concise message such as "Cleanup loop condition skips the 0th element" or "Incorrect cleanup loop condition: should be '--i >= 0'".
   • Use the bug reporting facilities (e.g. std::make_unique<BasicBugReport> or std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>) to emit this warning.

6. Summary of chosen callbacks and program state:
   • No need for additional program state maps; simple AST traversal is sufficient.
   • Main callback: checkASTCodeBody to process functions and their bodies.
   • Use helper utility functions (findSpecificTypeInChildren, ExprHasName) if needed to navigate the AST.
   • Keep the report message short and clear as per the suggestions.

Following these concrete steps will allow you to implement the checker that detects the improper loop iteration condition in the error cleanup loop.
