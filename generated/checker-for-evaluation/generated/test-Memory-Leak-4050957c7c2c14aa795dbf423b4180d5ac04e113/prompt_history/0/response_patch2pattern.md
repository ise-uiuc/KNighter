## Bug Pattern

Incorrect iteration in the error cleanup loop where the loopâ€™s termination condition fails to include the first (0th) element. In this pattern, when rolling back partially initialized resources (here, clocks), the loop uses a condition like "while (--i > 0)" which skips cleanup for index 0, potentially leaving the first resource enabled. The proper approach is to use a condition that includes index 0 (e.g., "while (--i >= 0)").
