1. Decide on Program States:
   • No custom program states are necessary for this checker because our focus is on detecting an off‐by‑one error in a specific loop condition rather than tracking pointer aliasing or taint information.

2. Choose Callback Functions:
   • Use checkASTCodeBody to analyze the body of functions.
   • Additionally, if preferred, use checkPreStmt to hook at the WhileStmt nodes.

3. Implementation Steps:
   a. Within checkASTCodeBody, visit each function definition. Traverse the AST of each function to search for the pattern of the cleanup loop.
   b. Identify the error handling branch by looking for an if-statement that checks the return value of clk_prepare_enable (or similar) and contains a loop that calls clk_disable_unprepare.
   c. Locate the WhileStmt inside that error-handling block. Use AST traversal (or findSpecificTypeInChildren) to fetch the WhileStmt from the if-statement body.
   d. Analyze the condition of the WhileStmt:
      – Check that the condition is a BinaryOperator.
      – Confirm that the left-hand side of the BinaryOperator is a UnaryOperator using the prefix decrement (--) on the loop variable (for example, “i”). You may use the utility function ExprHasName to verify the occurrence of the variable name.
      – Validate that the comparison operator in the BinaryOperator is “>” and that the right-hand side is an integer literal with a value 0.
   e. If all the above conditions match, then the loop condition is likely using “while (--i > 0)” instead of the corrected “while (--i >= 0)”.
   f. Use generateNonFatalErrorNode or create a BasicBugReport/PathSensitiveBugReport (with a short and clear message such as "Off-by-one error in cleanup loop; first element may not be released") to report the bug.

4. Final Touches:
   • Ensure your traversal is minimal and directly focuses on while loop conditions in error paths.
   • Keep the error message short and clear as per the suggestions.
   • This simple approach uses AST pattern matching without extra state management, making the checker straightforward to implement.
