Plan: Checker for returning an uninitialized local status variable (e.g., “ret”)

1) Program state
- Keep it minimal and path-sensitive.
- REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(StatusVarAssignedMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
  - Key: VarRegion of the local status variable.
  - Value: true if definitely assigned on the current path; false if declared without initializer and not yet assigned.
- Optional (to avoid duplicate reports on the same path):
  - REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ReportedSet, const MemRegion*)
  - Only report once per region per path.

2) Helper predicates/utilities
- isCandidateStatusVar(const VarDecl* VD, const CheckerContext &C):
  - Return true iff all hold:
    - VD->hasLocalStorage() is true and not VD->isStaticLocal()
    - VD->getType()->isIntegerType()
    - VD->hasInit() is false (declared without initializer)
    - Function being analyzed returns an integer type (getEnclosingFunctionDecl()->getReturnType()->isIntegerType())
    - VD->getName() is one of {"ret", "rc", "err"} (include at least "ret"; configurable; keep it strict by default).
- getVarRegion(const VarDecl *VD, CheckerContext &C):
  - Use C.getState()->getRegionManager().getVarRegion(VD, C.getLocationContext()) to obtain the VarRegion.
- isReturnedTrackedVar(const ReturnStmt *RS, CheckerContext &C, const MemRegion *&R):
  - Let E = RS->getRetValue(); if null, return false.
  - E = E->IgnoreParenImpCasts().
  - If E is a DeclRefExpr to a local VarDecl (candidate or not), get its MemRegion via the provided utility getMemRegionFromExpr(E, C). If R belongs to StatusVarAssignedMap, return true.

3) Callbacks and their logic

A) checkPostStmt(const DeclStmt *DS, CheckerContext &C)
- Goal: Register candidate status variables (e.g., “int ret;”) as uninitialized.
- For each Decl in DS:
  - If it is a VarDecl* VD and isCandidateStatusVar(VD, C):
    - const MemRegion *R = getVarRegion(VD, C).
    - If R is non-null, add (R -> false) into StatusVarAssignedMap.
- Rationale: Tracks only candidate status variables that are declared without initializer.

B) checkBind(SVal Loc, SVal Val, const Stmt *S, CheckerContext &C)
- Goal: Mark the tracked local status variable as assigned whenever there is a store to it (direct assignment, compound assignment, increments, etc.).
- Get const MemRegion *R = Loc.getAsRegion(); if null, return.
- Use R = R->getBaseRegion() for robustness.
- If StatusVarAssignedMap contains R:
  - Update (R -> true) in the map.
- Rationale: Any store to the tracked variable makes it initialized on that path.

C) checkPreStmt(const ReturnStmt *RS, CheckerContext &C)
- Goal: Detect returns of a tracked status variable while it may be uninitialized on the current path.
- Early-out if the enclosing function’s return type is not an integer type.
- If isReturnedTrackedVar(RS, C, R) is true:
  - Lookup R in StatusVarAssignedMap.
  - If found and value is false (uninitialized), or not found but the VD meets the candidate criteria:
    - If using ReportedSet and R is already present, skip.
    - Generate a non-fatal error node.
    - Emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message: "returning uninitialized local 'ret'".
    - Optionally add a note range at the DeclStmt where the variable was declared (by retrieving its SourceRange from the VarDecl).
    - Insert R into ReportedSet (if used).
- Rationale: The analyzer will explore both paths; it will report precisely where the variable remains uninitialized when returned.

4) Optional refinements (keep simple if unnecessary)
- Support more status variable names: {"ret", "rc", "err"}; you can add others if needed.
- If you want to be more general (but risk more noise), you can remove the name heuristic and track any local integer variable that is returned by value. In that case, only insert into the map when the VarDecl is uninitialized and either:
  - The function returns an integer type; and
  - The variable is used as a return value later (you can keep the broad registration and rely on path-sensitivity).
- To reduce noise further, only track variables that are used in at least one ReturnStmt (you can detect this in checkASTCodeBody by scanning the function body once, but this adds complexity; typically unnecessary).

5) Notes on corner cases and why they are handled
- Assignments from multiple places (including inside loops/gotos) are covered by checkBind; path-sensitivity ensures that if a path doesn’t perform an assignment, the map still says false, producing a warning on return.
- “No loop iterations” case (e.g., assignment inside a loop that may not run) is naturally caught: the path skipping the loop body will keep the variable uninitialized.
- Compound assignments (+=, ++, etc.) still bind a value to the variable; checkBind will mark the variable as assigned, which is conservative and good enough for this bug pattern focusing on the return.
- Return expressions using casts or parentheses are handled via IgnoreParenImpCasts() and the getMemRegionFromExpr utility.

6) Bug report
- Type: BugType("Uninitialized return", "Logic error")
- Message: "returning uninitialized local 'ret'"
- Emit via generateNonFatalErrorNode and PathSensitiveBugReport
- Keep the message short and clear as required.
