## Bug Pattern

Returning an uninitialized status variable. The function declares a local int ret; and only assigns it in error paths within loops/conditionals, then falls through to return ret on the success path. If no errors occur (or certain branches arenâ€™t taken), ret remains uninitialized and is returned, leading to undefined behavior. The correct pattern is to initialize ret to 0 (success) at declaration or ensure all exit paths assign it.
