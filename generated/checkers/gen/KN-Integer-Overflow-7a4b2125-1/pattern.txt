## Bug Pattern

Calling roundup_pow_of_two(x) on an unchecked 32-bit unsigned long input and then detecting overflow by testing the result (e.g., if (!n)).

Pattern:
- n = roundup_pow_of_two(x);
- if (!n) /* treat as overflow */

Why itâ€™s buggy:
- On 32-bit arches, if x > 1UL << 31, roundup_pow_of_two() may internally perform a left shift by 32, which is undefined behavior. This can produce non-zero garbage, so the post-call check (!n) can fail to catch the overflow.

Correct approach:
- Pre-validate the input before calling roundup_pow_of_two():
  if (x > 1UL << (BITS_PER_LONG - 1))
      return -E2BIG;
  n = roundup_pow_of_two(x);
