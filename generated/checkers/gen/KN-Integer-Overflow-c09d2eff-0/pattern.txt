## Bug Pattern

Computing a size using 32-bit arithmetic and only then assigning it to a 64-bit variable, causing overflow before the assignment. Specifically, multiplying two 32-bit operands (e.g., u32 mall_size_per_umc and u32 num_umc) without promoting to 64-bit first:

u64 total = (u32)a * (u32)b;  // overflow happens in 32-bit
// Correct:
u64 total = (u64)a * b;  // force 64-bit arithmetic before assignment

This pattern arises when size/count calculations use narrower integer types for intermediate arithmetic even though the result is stored in a wider type.
