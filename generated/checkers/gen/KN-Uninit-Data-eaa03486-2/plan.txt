Plan

1. No custom program states
- Do not register any traits or maps. We can rely on the analyzer’s existing value-tracking to know whether a variable is undefined at a particular program point.

2. Callback choices and implementation details
- checkPreStmt(const ReturnStmt *, CheckerContext &C) const
  - Goal: Detect “return ret;” when ret is uninitialized on the current path.
  - Steps:
    1) Obtain the returned expression: const Expr *RetE = RS->getRetValue(); if null, skip.
    2) Limit to integer-returning functions to match the pattern:
       - Retrieve the current function decl from the location context:
         const auto *FD = dyn_cast_or_null<FunctionDecl>(C.getLocationContext()->getDecl());
         If FD is null or FD->getReturnType() is not an integer type, skip.
    3) Find a DeclRefExpr to a local variable inside the return expression:
       - Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<DeclRefExpr>(RetE). If not found, skip.
       - Get the referred VarDecl. Ensure it is a local var (hasLocalStorage()) and integral type.
       - Restrict to common status name to reduce noise:
         If VD->getName() is not "ret", skip. (This matches the target pattern and minimizes false positives.)
    4) Query the symbolic value at this program point:
       - SVal V = C.getState()->getSVal(RetE, C.getLocationContext()).
       - If V is UndefinedVal, this means the analyzer determined the value being returned is uninitialized on this path.
    5) Report the bug:
       - Create an error node with generateNonFatalErrorNode().
       - Emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message like:
         "Returning uninitialized 'ret'".
       - Highlight the return expression range.
       - Optionally, add an extra note range for the VarDecl location.

- Why this works:
  - This leverages the analyzer’s path-sensitive engine. If all the assignments to ‘ret’ are in conditionals or loops that might not execute (as in the maple cache functions), the value remains undefined along some paths. The SVal for the returned expression will be UndefinedVal on those paths. This avoids implementing our own dataflow and accurately flags exactly the risky return.

3. Optional refinements (keep off by default for simplicity)
- If you want to broaden detection slightly, allow additional common status names ("rc", "err", "status") by checking VD->getName() against a small whitelist. Keep disabled initially to avoid noise.
- If needed, confirm the variable was declared without an initializer:
  - In step 3, also check !VD->hasInit(). This can further reduce false positives while still detecting the target cases.
- If you want more precise highlighting, add a note to the declaration site of ‘ret’ using VD->getLocation().

4. Notes
- No need to hook if/loop conditions or maintain alias/state; the analyzer already computes undefinedness along paths.
- This also naturally handles returns via labels (goto out; return ret;), multiple returns, and loop-no-iteration cases.
- Keep the report short and clear as requested.
