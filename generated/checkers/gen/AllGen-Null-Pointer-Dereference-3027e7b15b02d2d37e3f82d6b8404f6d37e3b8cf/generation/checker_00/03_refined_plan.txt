Plan: Detect missing NULL-check after devm_kasprintf and subsequent use

1) Program state customizations
- REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PossibleNullPtrMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
  - Tracks regions returned by devm_kasprintf.
  - Value false = not NULL-checked yet; true = checked in any branch condition.
- REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
  - Tracks simple pointer aliasing: Dest -> Source, so we can propagate check status to aliases.

2) Helper utilities
- isDevmKasprintf(const CallEvent &Call): returns true when callee name == "devm_kasprintf".
- getRegionFromSValOrExpr(SVal SV, const Expr *E, CheckerContext &C):
  - Prefer SV.getAsRegion(); if null, use getMemRegionFromExpr(E, C). Returns canonical region pointer or null.
- canonicalize(const MemRegion *R):
  - If R is ElementRegion/FieldRegion/etc., return the base region (use getAs<...> and strip casts) to ensure stable map keys.
- setChecked(ProgramStateRef State, const MemRegion *R) -> ProgramStateRef:
  - Mark R as checked (true) in PossibleNullPtrMap.
  - Propagate to aliases:
    - For every entry (D->S) in PtrAliasMap, if S == R set D checked too.
    - Also if D == R set S checked (bidirectional propagation).
- isUncheckedPossiblyNull(ProgramStateRef State, const MemRegion *R) -> bool:
  - Look up canonicalized R (and its source via PtrAliasMap). Return true if in PossibleNullPtrMap and currently false.
- addAlias(ProgramStateRef State, const MemRegion *Dst, const MemRegion *Src) -> ProgramStateRef:
  - Record PtrAliasMap[Dst] = Src if both are non-null and different.
- report(CheckerContext &C, const Stmt *UseSite, const MemRegion *R, StringRef Why):
  - Generate non-fatal error node and emit PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message:
    - "Missing NULL-check after devm_kasprintf(); pointer may be NULL"
  - Note: Keep message short and consistent.

3) Known-deref function table
- Use provided functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams).
- Populate its table (DerefTable) with common kernel APIs that dereference string/pointer parameters:
  - strlen, strnlen, strcmp, strncmp, strcpy, strncpy, snprintf, vsnprintf
  - kstrdup, kasprintf
  - printk, pr_err, pr_warn, pr_info, pr_debug
  - dev_err, dev_warn, dev_info, dev_dbg
  - Any project-specific helpers that will dereference the given pointer (add as needed, e.g., ice_ptp_auxbus_create_id_table with the index of the name parameter).
- The checker will warn when an unchecked pointer is passed to a function known to dereference that parameter index.

4) Callback: checkPostCall
- Goal: record that the return value of devm_kasprintf may be NULL and is unchecked.
- Steps:
  - If !isDevmKasprintf(Call) return.
  - Obtain the return SVal: SVal Ret = Call.getReturnValue().
  - Get its region: const MemRegion *R = Ret.getAsRegion(); if null, bail (no tracking).
  - R = canonicalize(R).
  - State = State->set<PossibleNullPtrMap>(R, false).
  - Do not mark as checked here.
- Rationale: After devm_kasprintf we consider the returned pointer possibly NULL until a condition checks it.

5) Callback: checkBranchCondition
- Goal: detect typical NULL-check patterns and mark the pointer as checked.
- Patterns to recognize (use AST pattern matching):
  - UnaryOperator '!' applied to a pointer expression: if (!ptr)
  - BinaryOperator '==' or '!=' comparing a pointer expression with 0/NULL/nullptr: if (ptr == NULL), if (ptr != 0), etc.
  - Direct pointer-as-condition: if (ptr) or while (ptr)
- Implementation details:
  - Extract the pointer subexpression (use findSpecificTypeInChildren<DeclRefExpr> or inspect the condition recursively).
  - Ensure the subexpression has pointer type.
  - Get its MemRegion via getMemRegionFromExpr; canonicalize.
  - If the region exists, call setChecked(State, R) and Ctx.addTransition(State).
- Note: We treat any explicit test of the pointer as sufficient “checked”, regardless of the branch taken; both arms are considered checked post-condition.

6) Callback: checkPreCall
- Goal: flag immediate use when the unchecked pointer is passed to a function that dereferences it.
- Steps:
  - Determine if callee is known to dereference any params using functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams). If not, return.
  - For each param index i in DerefParams:
    - Get the corresponding argument Expr and SVal.
    - Extract the MemRegion (via SV.getAsRegion() or getMemRegionFromExpr).
    - Canonicalize it. If null, continue.
    - If isUncheckedPossiblyNull(State, R) is true:
      - report(C, Call.getOriginExpr(), R, "passed to a function that dereferences it").
      - Optionally, to reduce duplicate warnings, mark it checked afterward by calling setChecked(State, R); add transition.
- This covers cases like dev_err(..., "%s", name), strlen(name), helper(name), etc.

7) Callback: checkLocation
- Goal: catch direct dereferences/loads of the unchecked pointer.
- Triggered on both loads and stores.
- Steps:
  - If IsLoad is false, you can still treat as deref if writing via *ptr; either direction signals deref, but typically IsLoad covers reads; set to act on both loads and stores.
  - If Loc is a pointer SVal to a region, obtain the base MemRegion being dereferenced (for ElementRegion/fields, strip to base).
  - Canonicalize it.
  - If isUncheckedPossiblyNull(State, R) is true:
    - report(C, S, R, "dereferenced without NULL-check").
    - Optionally mark as checked to avoid repeated reports later in path.

8) Callback: checkBind
- Goal: maintain aliasing so that checks and uses on aliases are tracked.
- Steps:
  - If Val is a pointer SVal with a MemRegion SVR, and Loc is a MemRegion LVR that stores a pointer:
    - Canonicalize both.
    - addAlias(State, LVR, SVR) and add transition.
  - Do not alter PossibleNullPtrMap here.
- Examples:
  - name_alias = name;
  - obj->name = name; (will record alias from the field region to the original pointer region; later use of obj->name can be detected if it flows into a known-deref call or is dereferenced)

9) Optional: checkPreStmt(ReturnStmt) or checkEndFunction
- Not required. The main logic is already covered by earlier callbacks.

10) Reporting policy
- Use generateNonFatalErrorNode() and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport.
- Titles/messages (short and clear):
  - "Missing NULL-check after devm_kasprintf()"
  - Describe the specific use: "pointer may be NULL and is dereferenced" or "passed to a function that dereferences it".
- Point the report location at the use site (call expr or dereference statement).
- Do not over-annotate; short message per Suggestions.

11) Precision and false-positive control
- Only track pointers returned by devm_kasprintf (isDevmKasprintf gate).
- Consider a pointer “checked” only when it appears in the branch condition patterns described.
- Use functionKnownToDeref to limit call-site warnings to functions very likely to dereference the argument.
- Aliasing kept simple with one-hop mapping; setChecked should propagate to aliases both directions to reduce missed checks.

12) Minimal KnownDeref table to seed
- strlen, strnlen, strcmp, strncmp
- strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strncat
- printk, pr_err, pr_warn, pr_info, pr_debug
- dev_err, dev_warn, dev_info, dev_dbg
- vsnprintf, snprintf
- Any project-local helpers known to deref the string parameter (e.g., ice_ptp_auxbus_create_id_table for the "name" argument index)

This plan directly detects the target bug pattern:
- It tracks devm_kasprintf returns as possibly NULL.
- It requires an explicit check in a branch condition to mark them safe.
- It reports when the unchecked pointer is dereferenced or passed into functions that dereference it (including logging and helper calls), matching the missing NULL-check issues fixed by the patch.
