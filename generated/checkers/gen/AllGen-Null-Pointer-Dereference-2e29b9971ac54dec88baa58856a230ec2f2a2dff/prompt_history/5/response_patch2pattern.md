## Bug Pattern

Checking the wrong pointer for NULL after allocating memory.

Pattern:
ptrA = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!ptrB)   // BUG: should check ptrA
    return -ENOMEM;

In the patch, memory is allocated for dst->thread.sve_state, but the code erroneously checks dst->thread.za_state instead. This can both miss allocation failures of sve_state and incorrectly report errors based on an unrelated pointer, leading to inconsistent state or later NULL dereferences.
