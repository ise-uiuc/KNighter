Plan

1) Program state customization
- Register two maps:
  - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(DevmPtrState, const MemRegion *, unsigned)
    - 0 = Unchecked (may be NULL), 1 = Checked (proven non-NULL on this path).
  - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion *, const MemRegion *)
    - Maps an alias region to a canonical/source region. Use it to propagate the Checked/Unchecked state across assignments and indirections.

- Helpers:
  - canonical(const MemRegion *R, ProgramStateRef S): Follow PtrAliasMap chains until a region with no parent to find the root.
  - setStateForRegionAndAliases(State, Root, NewState): Iterate PtrAliasMap to set the same state for all aliases of Root.
  - isKnownDevmAllocatorName(StringRef Fn): return true if Fn ∈ {"devm_kzalloc","devm_kmalloc","devm_kcalloc","devm_kmalloc_array","devm_kstrdup"} (extendable).
  - getPtrRegionFromExpr(const Expr *E, CheckerContext &C): return canonical(getMemRegionFromExpr(E)), if any.

2) Callback functions and implementation details

A) checkBind(SVal Loc, SVal Val, const Stmt *S, CheckerContext &C) const
- Goal: Track devm_* allocation results assigned to storage and propagate aliasing.
- Steps:
  1) Extract the destination region:
     - If auto MR = Loc.getAsRegion(), canonicalize it (RootDst = canonical(MR, C.getState())). If null, return.
  2) Case 1: Binding a devm_* call result.
     - Try to find the call producing the bound value: const CallExpr *CE = findSpecificTypeInChildren<CallExpr>(S).
     - If CE and callee name is a known devm allocator (isKnownDevmAllocatorName), then:
       - State = State->set<DevmPtrState>(RootDst, 0 /*Unchecked*/).
       - State = State->remove<PtrAliasMap>(RootDst) to make RootDst canonical.
       - C.addTransition(State).
       - return.
  3) Case 2: Binding from another pointer (aliasing).
     - If const MemRegion *SrcR = Val.getAsRegion():
       - RootSrc = canonical(SrcR, State).
       - If RootSrc has an entry in DevmPtrState:
         - Copy state: unsigned St = State->get<DevmPtrState>(RootSrc); State = State->set<DevmPtrState>(RootDst, St).
         - Record alias: State = State->set<PtrAliasMap>(RootDst, RootSrc).
         - C.addTransition(State); return.
     - Otherwise, if RHS is not tracked (e.g., integer constant, non-devm pointer):
       - Clear destination from maps to avoid stale state: State = State->remove<DevmPtrState>(RootDst); State = State->remove<PtrAliasMap>(RootDst).
       - C.addTransition(State).

B) checkBranchCondition(const Stmt *Condition, CheckerContext &C) const
- Goal: Mark pointers as “Checked” when they are used in a NULL-test.
- Recognize the following patterns (ignore implicit casts):
  1) UnaryOperator ‘!’ on a pointer expression: if (!p)
     - Extract region R = getPtrRegionFromExpr(UO->getSubExpr()).
     - If R is tracked in DevmPtrState, set it to Checked (1), and also update all its aliases via setStateForRegionAndAliases.
  2) BinaryOperator ‘==’ or ‘!=’ with one operand a tracked pointer and the other a null literal/0:
     - Identify the pointer operand’s region R.
     - When operator is ‘!=’ or ‘==’, conservatively mark R as Checked (1), since typical code returns on the NULL branch and dereferences on the non-NULL path. This heuristic keeps the checker simple and effective for probe-style code.
- Implementation details:
  - Use dyn_cast to UnaryOperator/BinaryOperator, strip implicit casts.
  - Use getPtrRegionFromExpr(E, C) for the pointer side.
  - Update state: State = State->set<DevmPtrState>(Root, 1) and for aliases.
  - C.addTransition(State).

C) checkLocation(SVal Loc, bool IsLoad, const Stmt *S, CheckerContext &C) const
- Goal: Detect dereferences of unchecked devm_* pointers.
- Determine whether the current access dereferences a tracked pointer:
  1) Try to locate a MemberExpr in the parents: const MemberExpr *ME = findSpecificTypeInParents<MemberExpr>(S, C).
     - If ME && ME->isArrow(): the base is a pointer dereference.
     - Base region: R = getPtrRegionFromExpr(ME->getBase(), C).
  2) If not a MemberExpr, check for UnaryOperator ‘*’:
     - const UnaryOperator *UO = findSpecificTypeInParents<UnaryOperator>(S, C).
     - If UO && UO->getOpcode() == UO_Deref: R = getPtrRegionFromExpr(UO->getSubExpr(), C).
  3) Also check ArraySubscriptExpr: const ArraySubscriptExpr *ASE = findSpecificTypeInParents<ArraySubscriptExpr>(S, C).
     - If ASE: R = getPtrRegionFromExpr(ASE->getBase(), C).
- If a base region R was found:
  - Root = canonical(R, State).
  - If DevmPtrState contains Root with value 0 (Unchecked), report a bug:
    - Node = C.generateNonFatalErrorNode(); if (!Node) return;
    - Emit PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message like: “Unchecked devm allocation may be NULL and is dereferenced.”
    - Optionally, add source ranges for the dereference expression for better diagnostics.
- Optional noise reduction: If the analyzer already proves the pointer non-NULL on this path, it won’t typically store Unchecked in our map due to BranchCondition marking; keeping the check simple is sufficient for this pattern.

D) checkPreCall(const CallEvent &Call, CheckerContext &C) const
- Goal: Catch passing an unchecked devm pointer to functions known to dereference their parameters.
- Steps:
  1) Use functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams). If true, iterate indices in DerefParams:
     - For each i, get Expr *ArgE = Call.getArgExpr(i); find R = getPtrRegionFromExpr(ArgE, C); Root = canonical(R).
     - If Root is in DevmPtrState with value 0 (Unchecked), report:
       - Node = C.generateNonFatalErrorNode(); if (Node) emit report: “Unchecked devm allocation may be NULL and is passed to a function that dereferences it.”

E) checkPostCall(const CallEvent &Call, CheckerContext &C) const
- Not strictly required if checkBind handles devm allocations; keep empty or use it only to extend support for cases where the return is directly used without assignment:
  - If the return value of a known devm allocator is immediately dereferenced (rare), the engine will invoke checkLocation for that dereference; no extra work is necessary here.

3) Additional practical notes
- Canonicalization and alias updates:
  - Implement canonical by following PtrAliasMap until no parent exists.
  - setStateForRegionAndAliases should scan PtrAliasMap’s entries to propagate Checked/Unchecked consistently among aliases. For performance, you can limit propagation to the small number of aliases typically seen in driver probe paths.
- State cleanup on overwrites:
  - In checkBind, if destination is overwritten with non-tracked sources (e.g., constants, other pointers not from devm), remove destination from both maps to avoid stale warnings.
- Targeted function names:
  - Start with the common allocators: devm_kzalloc, devm_kmalloc, devm_kcalloc, devm_kmalloc_array, devm_kstrdup.
  - This is easily extendable by adding to the name list or using a prefix “devm_k” if desired.

4) What this catches in the target patch
- spi_bus->spi_int[iter] is assigned from devm_kzalloc(...) in a bind event: we store it as Unchecked.
- Immediately after, spi_sub_ptr = spi_bus->spi_int[iter]; in bind: we propagate Unchecked to spi_sub_ptr via alias map.
- Next, spi_sub_ptr->spi_host = ... triggers checkLocation; base region is spi_sub_ptr, which is Unchecked, so we emit a report: “Unchecked devm allocation may be NULL and is dereferenced.”
- If an explicit check “if (!spi_bus->spi_int[iter]) return -ENOMEM;” is added, BranchCondition marks it Checked, and no warning is emitted.
