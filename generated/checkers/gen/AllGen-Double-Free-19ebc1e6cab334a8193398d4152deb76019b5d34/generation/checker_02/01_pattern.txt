## Bug Pattern

Unconditional kfree() in a common cleanup label combined with a retry/replay loop, while the freed pointer is not reset to NULL on loop restart. This lets a dangling pointer value persist across iterations, so an early goto to the cleanup before reallocation triggers a second kfree() on already-freed memory.

Pattern sketch:
replay_again:
    /* ... */
    if (error_before_alloc)
        goto out;
    p = kmalloc(...);
    if (!p)
        goto out;
    /* ... */
out:
    kfree(p);     /* unconditional free */
    if (should_retry)
        goto replay_again;  /* p not reset to NULL -> possible double free on next early exit */
