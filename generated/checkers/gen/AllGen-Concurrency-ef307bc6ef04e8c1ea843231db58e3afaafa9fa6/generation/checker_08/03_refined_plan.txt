Goal
Detect inconsistent locking on a shared pointer leading to a check-then-use race:
- A reader path checks a shared pointer under a spinlock and then uses it under that lock.
- A writer path clears the same pointer to NULL outside the protecting lock.

We will implement an AST-oriented checker that:
1) Summarizes “reader” patterns (NULL-check and subsequent use of a pointer under a specific spinlock).
2) Summarizes “writer” patterns (assignment of the same pointer to NULL while not holding that spinlock).
3) Matches readers to writers across functions and reports when a writer clears the pointer without holding the lock that protects the reader.

1) Program State
- No custom symbolic program state is needed. We will not use REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE or REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE.
- Store cross-function summaries in checker member containers (vectors/maps) and consolidate in checkEndAnalysis.

2) Callback Functions
- checkASTCodeBody(const Decl *D, AnalysisManager &Mgr, BugReporter &BR):
  Purpose: Walk each function body’s AST to extract “ReaderFacts” and “WriterFacts”.
  Steps:
  a. Preparation
     - Obtain ASTContext, SourceManager, LangOptions via Mgr.getASTContext().
     - Define helper to extract textual representation for expressions: getExprText(E) using Lexer::getSourceText on token range (same approach as ExprHasName does internally).
     - Define recognizers for spin locks:
       • Lock calls: spin_lock, spin_lock_irqsave, spin_lock_bh.
       • Unlock calls: spin_unlock, spin_unlock_irqrestore, spin_unlock_bh.
       For a CallExpr CE, isSpinLock(CE, &LockTextOut) returns true and captures LockTextOut as text of CE->getArg(0). Similarly for isSpinUnlock.
     - Define recognizer for NULL literal: isNullLiteral(Expr *E) detects IntegerLiteral 0, GNUNullExpr, or CXXNullPtrLiteralExpr, and also macro NULL (by token text match).
     - Define recognizer to extract pointer being checked in conditions:
       • isNullCheckOrTruthiness(const Expr *Cond, std::string &PtrTextOut) returns true if:
         - UnaryOperator ‘!’ applied to a pointer expr: !P
         - BinaryOperator ‘==’ or ‘!=’ with one side NULL and the other side a pointer expr: (P == NULL), (NULL == P), (P != NULL)
         - Plain pointer truthiness: if (P)
         Extract PtrTextOut using getExprText on the pointer side (IgnoreParenImpCasts).
     - Define use detection: isPointerUseOf(const Stmt *S, StringRef PtrText, ASTContext &Ctx) returns true if within S we see:
         - A CallExpr argument whose source text contains PtrText (use ExprHasName for convenience).
         - A UnaryOperator UO_Deref whose subexpr contains PtrText.
         - A MemberExpr with isArrow() whose base contains PtrText.
       Note: Optionally refine by functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams) and checking if PtrText matches one of those argv expressions, to reduce false positives. If the table is empty/not found, fall back to generic argument/use matching.
  b. Traversal and lock region tracking
     - Traverse the function body statements in source order (write a simple recursive walker). Maintain:
       • LockStack: vector<string> for currently-held locks (top is innermost).
       • For the currently held lock (top), maintain a small per-lock map of “last checked pointer” to the source location it was checked: CheckedByLock[LockText] -> set/map of PtrText -> CheckLoc.
     - At each CallExpr:
       • If isSpinLock, push LockText onto LockStack.
       • If isSpinUnlock, pop one (if matches; best-effort LIFO).
       • Otherwise normal call, also evaluate for use:
         If LockStack not empty, for each Ptr in CheckedByLock[topLock], if isPointerUseOf(call, Ptr), record a ReaderFact:
           ReaderFacts.emplace_back(Lock=topLock, Ptr=Ptr, FD, CheckLoc, UseLoc=call->getExprLoc()).
     - At each IfStmt:
       • If LockStack not empty:
         Extract its condition; if isNullCheckOrTruthiness, get PtrTextOut and record CheckedByLock[topLock].insert(PtrTextOut) with CheckLoc = IfStmt->getIfLoc().
       • Optionally, also check for uses in its then/else while still the same lock is held (the recursive traversal will naturally find uses under this lock).
     - At each UnaryOperator / MemberExpr:
       • If LockStack not empty, check if it uses any Ptr in CheckedByLock[topLock]. If yes, record a ReaderFact with current node’s location as UseLoc.
     - At each BinaryOperator (assignment):
       • If it is LHS = RHS, RHS is NULL literal, and LHS is pointer-typed:
           - Extract PtrTextLHS = getExprText(LHS->IgnoreParenImpCasts()).
           - Let HeldLocks = set of LockStack contents (strings).
           - Record a WriterFact: {Ptr = PtrTextLHS, HeldLocks, FD, AssignLoc = BO->getOperatorLoc()}.
     - Important: We do not emit any report in this callback; we only collect facts.

- checkEndAnalysis(ExplodedGraph &G, BugReporter &BR, ExprEngine &Eng):
  Purpose: Connect readers with writers across the TU and emit reports.
  Steps:
  a. For every ReaderFact R with (LockTextR, PtrTextR):
     - For every WriterFact W with PtrTextW equal to PtrTextR:
       • If W.HeldLocks does NOT contain LockTextR:
         - Emit a BasicBugReport at W.AssignLoc.
         - Message: "Clearing ‘PtrTextR’ outside lock ‘LockTextR’; can race with NULL-checked use under lock."
         - One report per W/R pair is enough; de-duplicate if desired (e.g., use a small set of (W.AssignLoc, LockTextR, PtrTextR)).
  b. Create a BugType member once (e.g., "Inconsistent locking on shared pointer") and reuse it.

3) Matching and Normalization Details
- Expression identity:
  - We use source text string equality for both lock and pointer identification:
    • LockText: text of the first argument of a spin_lock/spin_unlock (e.g., "&hsotg->lock" or "(&hsotg->lock)").
    • PtrText: text of the pointer expression (e.g., "urb->hcpriv").
  - To improve robustness, normalize by stripping surrounding parentheses and whitespace from the text. For locks, also remove a leading '&' when present so "&hsotg->lock" and "hsotg->lock" unify.
- Use detection:
  - Prefer functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams) when available; otherwise treat passing pointer as an argument as a use. Also detect explicit deref operators (*P) and P->field.
- Lock variants:
  - Recognize at least:
    • spin_lock, spin_lock_irqsave, spin_lock_bh as lock-acquire.
    • spin_unlock, spin_unlock_irqrestore, spin_unlock_bh as lock-release.
  - Only the first parameter is used to identify the lock.
- NULL checks:
  - Support: !P, P == NULL, NULL == P, P != NULL, and if (P).
  - For truthiness (if (P)), treat as a check; combine with a subsequent “use” to build a reader fact.

4) Reporting
- Report site: at the writer assignment location where Ptr = NULL happens while not holding the reader’s lock.
- Bug type: "Inconsistent locking on a shared pointer".
- Message: short and clear: "Clearing ‘urb->hcpriv’ outside lock ‘hsotg->lock’; can race with NULL-checked use under lock."
- Use BasicBugReport with the assignment SourceLocation as the primary location.

5) Notes and Simplifications
- No path-sensitive state, no alias tracking: we rely on string equality of expressions; this is sufficient for the target patch since both functions use the same textual expressions "hsotg->lock" and "urb->hcpriv".
- This also detects the local anti-pattern in the patch where spin_unlock precedes “urb->hcpriv = NULL” (the writer fact will have an empty HeldLocks set).
- False positives are reduced by requiring:
  - A reader fact must have both a NULL-check and a subsequent use of the pointer under the same lock, within the same locked region.
  - A writer is only flagged if it clears the exact same pointer text and does not hold the reader’s lock at that assignment point.

6) Optional Refinements (if needed)
- De-duplicate reports across different reader functions (same (Ptr, Lock, WriterLoc)).
- Enhance pointer “use” recognition using functionKnownToDeref to limit to calls that likely dereference their pointer parameters.
- Add minimal normalization so "&hsotg->lock" and "hsotg->lock" match across code variations.
