## Bug Pattern

Inconsistent locking on a shared pointer used in a check-then-use sequence:
- One path (dequeue) checks and uses urb->hcpriv while holding hsotg->lock (if (!urb->hcpriv) ...; use(urb->hcpriv);).
- Another path (enqueue error path) writes urb->hcpriv = NULL after releasing hsotg->lock.
This unlock-before-write lets the writer race with the readerâ€™s locked check-then-use, allowing urb->hcpriv to become NULL between the check and use, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
