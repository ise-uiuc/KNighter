## Bug Pattern

Clearing or modifying a shared pointer (here, urb->hcpriv) outside the spinlock that protects it, while other paths read and use that pointer under the lock. Specifically:
- Reader: holds hsotg->lock, checks if (urb->hcpriv) and then uses urb->hcpriv.
- Writer: releases hsotg->lock (or never takes it) and then does urb->hcpriv = NULL.

This inconsistent locking creates a race where the reader passes the NULL check under the lock but the writer concurrently nulls the pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference during the subsequent use. The fix is to perform urb->hcpriv = NULL while holding hsotg->lock (before unlocking).
