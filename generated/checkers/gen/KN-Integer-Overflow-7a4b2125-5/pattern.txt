## Bug Pattern

Using roundup_pow_of_two(x) on a potentially large 32-bit unsigned long without first bounding x, and then relying on (result == 0) to detect overflow. On 32-bit arches, the internal left shift (e.g., 1UL << 32) in roundup_pow_of_two() invokes undefined behavior, so overflow may not produce zero, making the post-call zero check unreliable.
