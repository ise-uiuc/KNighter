## Bug Pattern

Freeing or iterating over elements of a shared list without holding the list’s designated lock (here, a spinlock) in a teardown/cleanup path. Specifically:
- The tx_ctrl_list/tx_data_list are protected by gsm->tx_lock, but gsm_cleanup_mux traversed and kfree’d their entries after releasing gsm->mutex and without taking gsm->tx_lock.
- Concurrent threads (e.g., via ioctl or work) can simultaneously access/remove the same list nodes, causing race conditions and use-after-free.
- Using list_for_each_entry_safe does not replace proper synchronization; the correct spinlock must be held when manipulating the shared lists.
