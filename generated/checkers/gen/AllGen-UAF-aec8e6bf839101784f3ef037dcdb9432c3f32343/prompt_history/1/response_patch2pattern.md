## Bug Pattern

A long-lived struct stores a reference-counted pointer (here, device->bdev_file) that is released (fput/close) but not cleared to NULL. Later code uses a non-NULL check on that field as a validity flag and reuses/fputs it again, leading to use-after-free. Specifically, cleanup sets related fields (device->bdev) to NULL but leaves device->bdev_file dangling, so subsequent paths that test if (device->bdev_file) will operate on freed memory.
