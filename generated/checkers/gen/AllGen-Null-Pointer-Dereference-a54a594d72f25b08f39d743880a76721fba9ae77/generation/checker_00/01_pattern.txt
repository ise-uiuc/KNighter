## Bug Pattern

Performing an invalid-parameter check that only logs but does not abort, then immediately dereferencing/using the parameter (and its fields) anyway—combined with doing this validation outside the lock that protects the related shared state. In code form:

if (!obj || obj->idx_invalid || obj->idx >= max)
    log("invalid")
/* no return */
lock()
idx = obj->idx            // potential NULL deref or stale/invalid index
use obj and array[idx]    // potential OOB/race

This “log-and-continue after failed check” plus “validation outside the protecting lock” pattern can lead to NULL pointer dereferences and race-induced invalid accesses.
