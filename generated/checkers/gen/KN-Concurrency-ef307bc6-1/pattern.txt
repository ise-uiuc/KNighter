## Bug Pattern

Inconsistent locking on a shared pointer leading to a check-then-use race:

- One path reads/checks and then uses a shared pointer under a spinlock.
- Another path clears/modifies the same pointer without holding that spinlock (or after unlocking).
- This allows the pointer to become NULL between the readerâ€™s check and use, causing a NULL dereference.

Concrete instance:
- Reader (dequeue) does:
  spin_lock(&hsotg->lock);
  if (urb->hcpriv)
      use(urb->hcpriv);
  spin_unlock(&hsotg->lock);
- Writer (enqueue failure path) did:
  spin_unlock(&hsotg->lock);
  urb->hcpriv = NULL;  // write outside the lock

Fix: perform urb->hcpriv = NULL while holding hsotg->lock so all reads/writes of the field are serialized by the same lock.
