Plan

1. Program State
- Register a set to remember heap objects that have been “released” (closed/freed) by known functions:
  - REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ReleasedRegions, const MemRegion *)
- Rationale: we only need to know “this object is invalid now”; aliases are unnecessary because we store the pointee’s MemRegion (the object region), which is shared among aliases.

2. Known invalidator functions
- Create a small static table for functions that may free/tear down specific pointer parameters:
  - mptcp_close_ssk: releases parameter index 2 (the subflow argument).
  - Optionally extendable (e.g., kfree: param 0, kvfree: param 0), but keep minimal to reduce false positives.
- Implement a helper similar to functionKnownToDeref:
  - struct KnownReleaseFunction { const char *Name; llvm::SmallVector<unsigned, 4> Params; };
  - bool functionKnownToRelease(const CallEvent &Call, llvm::SmallVectorImpl<unsigned> &RelParams)
    - Lookup by callee identifier name; if found, append indices to RelParams and return true.

3. Mark objects as released (checkPostCall)
- Callback: checkPostCall(const CallEvent &Call, CheckerContext &C)
- Steps:
  - If functionKnownToRelease(Call, RelParams) is true:
    - For each param index i in RelParams:
      - const Expr *ArgE = Call.getArgExpr(i).
      - const MemRegion *ObjR = getMemRegionFromExpr(ArgE, C)  // utility provided.
      - If ObjR is null, skip.
      - Normalize to base region:
        - while (const SubRegion *SR = dyn_cast<SubRegion>(ObjR)) ObjR = SR->getSuperRegion();
      - State = C.getState()->add<ReleasedRegions>(ObjR).
      - C.addTransition(State).
- Intent: after the call returns, the object is considered invalid; any subsequent dereference/read is a potential UAF.

4. Detect UAF reads (checkLocation)
- Callback: checkLocation(SVal Loc, bool IsLoad, const Stmt *S, CheckerContext &C)
- Steps:
  - Only trigger on loads: if (!IsLoad) return.
  - Extract the region being read:
    - const MemRegion *R = Loc.getAsRegion(); if (!R) return.
  - Normalize to base region (strip fields/elements):
    - while (const SubRegion *SR = dyn_cast<SubRegion>(R)) R = SR->getSuperRegion();
  - Check if R is in ReleasedRegions:
    - If yes, report a bug: “Use-after-close: reading object after call to a close/free routine.”
      - Node = C.generateNonFatalErrorNode();
      - If Node is null, return.
      - Create a BugType once (e.g., “UAF after close”) and a PathSensitiveBugReport with S->getSourceRange().
      - C.emitReport(std::move(Report)).
- Notes:
  - This catches cases like subflow->request_join reads (FieldRegion under the heap object).
  - Limiting to loads keeps focus on UAF reads (as in the patch).

5. Optional: limit noise
- To reduce false positives, keep the initial known-release table minimal (include only mptcp_close_ssk with param index 2).
- If needed, only warn on field/element reads (when the original Loc region is a FieldRegion/ElementRegion before lifting to base). This further focuses on “reading fields of a released struct”.

6. Lifecycle/Reset
- No special per-function reset is required; program state is path-sensitive. The set is updated by transitions and discarded when the path exits the function naturally.

7. Why this catches the target bug
- In the buggy code, mptcp_close_ssk(sk, ssk, subflow) is called, then subflow->request_join is read.
- checkPostCall marks the pointee region of “subflow” as released after the call.
- The subsequent field read triggers checkLocation; we normalize to the base object region and find it in ReleasedRegions, emitting a UAF read warning.

8. Utilities to use
- getMemRegionFromExpr to obtain the pointee MemRegion from a call argument expression.
- No need for extra alias tracking; the MemRegion of the object is stable across aliases.
- ExprHasName and evaluation helpers are not necessary for this checker.
