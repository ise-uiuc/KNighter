1. Program State
- Define a single program-state map to track freed objects:
  - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedRegionMap, const MemRegion*, bool)
    - Key: the base MemRegion of the object that has been freed/destroyed.
    - Value: always true (presence in the map indicates “freed”).
- Do not track pointer aliasing explicitly. We will track the base region of the pointed-to object; any later dereference computes a Field/Element region whose base matches the freed base. This keeps the checker simple and still catches the target pattern reliably.

2. Helper Utilities
- Implement helper functions:
  - static const MemRegion* getPointeeBaseRegionFromArg(const CallEvent &Call, unsigned Idx, CheckerContext &C):
    - SVal V = Call.getArgSVal(Idx); if V is loc::MemRegionVal, return V.getAsRegion()->getBaseRegion(); else return nullptr.
  - static const MemRegion* getBaseFromLocSVal(SVal Loc):
    - If Loc has region, return Region->getBaseRegion(); else return nullptr.
  - static bool isCloseLikeCall(const CallEvent &Call, unsigned &FreedParamIndex):
    - Return true if callee name is "mptcp_close_ssk"; set FreedParamIndex = 2 (third parameter, the subflow).
- Optionally reuse provided functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams) to detect dereferencing of freed objects when passed to other calls.

3. checkPostCall – mark freed objects
- Goal: When a function that can free/destroy an object is called, mark the base region of the pointee as freed in the program state after the call.
- Steps:
  - Identify destructor/free-like calls via isCloseLikeCall(Call, FreedIdx).
    - Specifically: mptcp_close_ssk(sk, ssk, subflow) frees/destroys the subflow (index 2).
  - Compute TargetBase = getPointeeBaseRegionFromArg(Call, FreedIdx, C).
    - If null, bail.
  - State = State->set<FreedRegionMap>(TargetBase, true).
  - C.addTransition(State).
- Rationale: In the target bug, subflow->request_join is read after mptcp_close_ssk(), which may release the subflow via RCU. Marking it as freed immediately after the call ensures any later access is flagged.

4. checkLocation – detect post-call use of freed objects
- Goal: Catch any memory load/store from a region whose base was marked freed.
- Trigger: On both loads and stores (IsLoad can be true or false; reading or writing freed memory is bad).
- Steps:
  - If SVal Loc has a region, compute Base = getBaseFromLocSVal(Loc).
  - Query FreedRegionMap for Base.
  - If found:
    - Generate a non-fatal error node.
    - Emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a concise message:
      - "Use-after-free: object accessed after mptcp_close_ssk."
    - The report location should be S (the statement that performed the load/store).
- This directly flags patterns like: removed |= subflow->request_join; that occur after the destructor call.

5. checkPreCall – detect passing freed objects to functions known to dereference
- Goal: Optionally catch UAFs when the freed pointer is passed to a function that is known to dereference it.
- Steps:
  - Use functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams).
  - For each param index P in DerefParams:
    - Base = getPointeeBaseRegionFromArg(Call, P, C).
    - If Base ∈ FreedRegionMap:
      - Emit a warning at the call site:
        - "Use-after-free: freed object passed to a function that dereferences it."
- This increases coverage beyond field reads, but is optional and simple to implement using the provided utility.

6. Transitions and Cleanup
- No special cleanup needed in checkEndFunction or checkRegionChanges; the freed base regions should persist as long as the path persists, which is correct for UAF detection in the local path.
- If a pointer variable is rebound to another object, the dereference base changes; we match on the base of the dereference, so no alias map is needed.

7. Reporting
- Create a BugType member, e.g., "Use-after-free after close/free-like call".
- Messages should be short and clear:
  - Primary: "Use-after-free: object accessed after mptcp_close_ssk."
  - For checkPreCall case: "Use-after-free: freed object passed to a function that dereferences it."
- Use std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport> and generateNonFatalErrorNode for path-sensitive reporting.

8. Why this catches the target patch pattern
- In the buggy code, subflow->request_join is read after mptcp_close_ssk(..., subflow) returns. Our checkPostCall marks the base of the subflow object as freed. The subsequent field access triggers checkLocation, which finds the base region in FreedRegionMap and reports the UAF. After the patch, the read happens before mptcp_close_ssk(), so the region is not yet marked freed, and no warning is emitted.
