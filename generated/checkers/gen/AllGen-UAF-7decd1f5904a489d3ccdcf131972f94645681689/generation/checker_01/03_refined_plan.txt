Plan

1. Program State
- REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedRegions, const MemRegion*)
  - Tracks pointee regions that have been freed (or scheduled to be freed) by known free/close-like functions.
- (Optional, for better messages) REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(FreedByFuncMap, const MemRegion*, const char*)
  - Maps a freed region to the name of the function that freed it. Keep the function names as static const char* literals to be storable in program state.

2. Known “free-like” functions table
- Maintain a small static table of functions known to free or schedule freeing of their pointer parameters, with the indices of those parameters:
  - kfree: param 0
  - kvfree: param 0
  - kvfree_rcu: param 0
  - mptcp_close_ssk: param 2 (the subflow argument)
- Provide a helper similar to functionKnownToDeref:
  - bool functionKnownToFree(const CallEvent &Call, SmallVectorImpl<unsigned> &FreedParams, const char* &Name)
  - Looks up Call.getCalleeIdentifier()->getName() in the table and fills FreedParams with 0-based parameter indices and Name with the function name literal.

3. Helper functions (inside the checker)
- const MemRegion* getPointeeRegion(const Expr *E, CheckerContext &C)
  - Use getMemRegionFromExpr(E, C) from Utility Functions. It returns the region the pointer expression E points to (the pointee region). If null, do nothing.
- const MemRegion* getBaseRegion(const MemRegion *R)
  - Climb super regions: while (const SubRegion *SR = dyn_cast<SubRegion>(R)) R = SR->getSuperRegion();
  - Returns the “root” region representing the whole object. This normalizes field/element regions to the owning object’s region.
- bool isFreed(const MemRegion *R, ProgramStateRef State)
  - Compute Base = getBaseRegion(R). Iterate over all entries F in FreedRegions; return true if Base == F or Base->isSubRegionOf(F) or F->isSubRegionOf(Base).
  - This ensures both base and subregion relationships are caught.
- ProgramStateRef markFreed(ProgramStateRef State, const MemRegion *R, const char *FnName)
  - Base = getBaseRegion(R); State = State->add<FreedRegions>(Base);
  - If using FreedByFuncMap: State = State->set<FreedByFuncMap>(Base, FnName);
  - Return updated State.

4. Callback: checkPostCall
- Purpose: Record regions freed by known free-like functions.
- Steps:
  - Extract the callee name. Call functionKnownToFree(...). If false, return.
  - For each freed parameter index i:
    - const Expr *ArgE = Call.getArgExpr(i);
    - const MemRegion *Pointee = getPointeeRegion(ArgE, C);
    - If Pointee is null, continue (unknown pointer).
    - State = markFreed(State, Pointee, Name);
  - Generate a new node with C.addTransition(State).

5. Callback: checkLocation
- Purpose: Detect reads from a freed object (field/element/member load).
- Trigger: IsLoad == true.
- Steps:
  - const MemRegion *R = Loc.getAsRegion(); if (!R) return.
  - If isFreed(R, State):
    - Create ExplodedNode *N = C.generateNonFatalErrorNode();
    - If (!N) return.
    - Prepare a concise message:
      - If using FreedByFuncMap and there is a mapping for getBaseRegion(R), include the function name:
        - "Use-after-free: read after call to ‘<func>’"
      - Else: "Use-after-free: read from freed object"
    - Emit report: auto BR = std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>(...).
    - Attach S as the interesting location; C.emitReport(std::move(BR)).

6. (Optional) Callback: checkEndFunction
- Clear per-path knowledge at function exit if desired (not strictly necessary; CSA path-sensitivity keeps it local anyway):
  - State = State->remove<FreedRegions>(all); State = State->remove<FreedByFuncMap>(all);
  - C.addTransition(State).

7. Notes to improve precision and reduce false positives
- The approach is path-sensitive: we only warn on dereferences that happen after the free-like call along the same path.
- We do not require alias tracking via a PtrAliasMap because we store the pointee MemRegion in FreedRegions and compare by region identity and subregion relation. Any alias dereferencing the same object will resolve to the same base region.
- We intentionally do not warn for “cache before free” patterns because the read happens before the markFreed in checkPostCall.
- We do not attempt to model re-allocation of the same variable: if a new allocation creates a new region, subsequent reads will no longer match the freed region, so no false positive is produced.

8. How this catches the target bug
- In mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow:
  - checkPostCall sees mptcp_close_ssk(sk, ssk, subflow) and marks the pointee region of subflow as freed.
  - The subsequent load of subflow->request_join triggers checkLocation. The loaded FieldRegion’s base region matches the FreedRegions entry, so the checker reports:
    - "Use-after-free: read after call to ‘mptcp_close_ssk’"
  - Moving the read (removed |= subflow->request_join) before mptcp_close_ssk prevents the warning, matching the provided fix.
