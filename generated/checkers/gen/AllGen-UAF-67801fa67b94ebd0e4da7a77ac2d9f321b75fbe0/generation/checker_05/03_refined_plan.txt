Goal
Detect when a kernel object is inserted into a user-visible ID/XArray (e.g., xa_alloc/idr_alloc/xa_store) before its creation path is finished, i.e., the object is still being initialized or referenced after publication. This early publication allows another thread to look up and destroy the object, leading to UAF.

1) Program State
- REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PublishedRegionMap, const MemRegion*, const Stmt*)
  - Key: The MemRegion of the object pointer published into the ID/XArray.
  - Value: The Stmt (call site) where publication occurred, used for diagnostics.
- REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)
  - Track pointer aliases so stores/calls via aliases are recognized.
- REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ReportedSet, const MemRegion*)
  - Ensure we only report once per published region.

Helpers (in checker)
- const MemRegion* getRootAlias(const MemRegion *R, ProgramStateRef State)
  - Resolve alias chains using PtrAliasMap to a canonical region.
- bool isIdPublishCall(const CallEvent &Call, unsigned &EntryArgIndex)
  - Return true for: xa_alloc (entry idx=2), xa_alloc_cyclic (2), xa_store (2),
    idr_alloc (1), idr_alloc_u32 (1), idr_replace (1), idr_alloc_cyclic (1).
- bool isMemberStoreToPublished(const Stmt *S, const MemRegion *PubR, CheckerContext &C)
  - Using findSpecificTypeInChildren<MemberExpr>(S) get the base expr of LHS store;
    if base region (via getMemRegionFromExpr) alias-resolves to PubR, return true.

2) Callbacks and Steps

A) checkPostCall (publish detection)
- If isIdPublishCall(Call, EntryArgIndex) is true:
  - Get the entry argument expression: const Expr *EntryE = Call.getArgExpr(EntryArgIndex).
  - const MemRegion *EntryR = getMemRegionFromExpr(EntryE, C).
  - If EntryR is null, do nothing (best-effort).
  - EntryR = getRootAlias(EntryR, State).
  - Insert into PublishedRegionMap[EntryR] = Call.getOriginExpr() (or Call.getStmt()).
  - Return without invalidation of prior state.

B) checkBind (detect post-publication writes to the object)
- Update pointer aliases:
  - If this is a pointer assignment p2 = p1:
    - Get MemRegion of p2 (the LHS) and p1 (the RHS) via getMemRegionFromExpr on the children exprs.
    - If both exist, record PtrAliasMap[p2] = getRootAlias(p1), and optionally the reverse for quicker resolution.
- Detect member stores to published object:
  - If the bound location corresponds to a member store (e.g., q->field = ...):
    - Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<MemberExpr>(S) to get the MemberExpr of LHS.
    - Get base region Rb = getMemRegionFromExpr(MemberExpr->getBase(), C).
    - If Rb exists, resolve Rr = getRootAlias(Rb, State). If Rr in PublishedRegionMap and Rr not in ReportedSet:
      - Report bug (see Reporting) because the object is being modified after being inserted into the ID/XArray.
      - Add Rr to ReportedSet to avoid duplicate reports.

C) checkPostCall (detect post-publication calls that likely mutate the object)
- For any call that is not a publish call:
  - For each argument i:
    - Get region Ri = getMemRegionFromExpr(Call.getArgExpr(i), C). If null, continue.
    - Ri = getRootAlias(Ri, State).
    - If Ri is in PublishedRegionMap:
      - Use functionKnownToDeref(Call, DerefParams). If returns true and i is in DerefParams:
        - If Ri not in ReportedSet: emit bug report (see Reporting) because a function call that dereferences the published object occurs after publication.
        - Add Ri to ReportedSet.

D) Optional: checkPreStmt(const ReturnStmt *)
- No reporting here unless needed. The core detection already triggers when a write/call after publish happens.

E) checkEndFunction / checkEndAnalysis
- No special action required (CSA will discard per-path state).
- Optionally, clear or rely on engine to clear maps.

3) Reporting
- On first detection of an operation after publication (either a member store or a known-deref call):
  - Create a non-fatal error node (generateNonFatalErrorNode).
  - Build a PathSensitiveBugReport with a concise message:
    - "Object inserted into ID/XArray before fully initialized; subsequent writes/calls detected. Potential UAF."
  - If available, add a note range to the publish site using the Stmt stored in PublishedRegionMap[Region]:
    - "Published here (ID allocation/insert)."
  - Add the current statement as the location of the post-publish operation:
    - "Modified/dereferenced here after publication."
  - Emit the report and mark Region in ReportedSet.

4) Precision and False-Positive Controls
- Only act when the published "entry" is a pointer-type MemRegion (ignore non-pointer/non-region entries).
- Require that the post-publication event is either:
  - A direct field store to the object (q->field = ...), or
  - A call known to deref the object pointer (via functionKnownToDeref).
- Do not warn on unrelated stores (e.g., args->id = id) since base region won’t match the published object region.
- Alias tracking ensures p and q aliases are recognized; do not propagate taint through non-pointer assignments.

5) Utility Functions Usage
- getMemRegionFromExpr: obtain MemRegion for pointers and member base expressions.
- findSpecificTypeInChildren<MemberExpr>: find member stores in the current bind statement.
- functionKnownToDeref: recognize calls that dereference pointer parameters.
- ExprHasName: optional fallback if you want to conservatively match that a certain variable name appears in a call arg, but prefer region-based matching.

6) Summary Logic
- Mark the object passed to xa_alloc/idr_alloc/xa_store as Published.
- If any write to that object (q->field) or known-deref call using that object occurs after publication within the same function path, report a bug. This captures the “publish must be last” rule and flags patterns like assigning q->xef after xa_alloc that can cause UAF on early lookup.
