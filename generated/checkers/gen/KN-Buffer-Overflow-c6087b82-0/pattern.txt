## Bug Pattern

Copying user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer using copy_from_user() with the unbounded user length (nbytes) instead of clamping it to the bufferâ€™s capacity (e.g., sizeof(buf) - 1). This allows a user to pass a size larger than the local array, causing a buffer overflow in debugfs write handlers (or similar file ops). The fix is to limit the copy length with min(nbytes, sizeof(buf) - 1) and return the actual consumed size.
