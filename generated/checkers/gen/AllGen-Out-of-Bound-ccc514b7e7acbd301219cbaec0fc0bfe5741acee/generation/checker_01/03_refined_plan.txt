1) Program state
- No custom program state is needed. This checker is a local, AST-driven pattern match that compares a loop’s upper bound against the compile-time size of arrays indexed inside the loop.

2) Callbacks and implementation steps
- Use only checkASTCodeBody. We statically inspect every function body, find for-loops that index arrays with the same induction variable, and compare the loop bound against the array sizes.

Step A. Walk all ForStmt in the body
- In checkASTCodeBody(const Decl *D, ...), traverse the AST of D (use a small RecursiveASTVisitor or a manual walk over Stmt children) to find every ForStmt.
- For each ForStmt FS, extract:
  - The loop induction variable Var (e.g., i).
    - From the init:
      - If it is a DeclStmt with a single VarDecl initialized to an integer literal 0, take that VarDecl as the induction variable.
      - Or if it is a BinaryOperator “i = 0”, take the DeclRefExpr on the LHS as the induction variable.
    - If neither pattern is matched, skip this loop (keep it simple).
  - The loop condition and bound:
    - Expect a BinaryOperator in the condition with one of: <, <=, >, >=.
    - Identify which side contains the induction variable (DeclRefExpr to Var).
    - The other side is the bound expression BoundE. Normalize to a strict upper bound:
      - If “i < N”: max iterations = N.
      - If “i <= N”: max iterations = N + 1.
      - If “i > N”: rewrite as “i >= N+1” to get a lower bound; since we look for overflow on upper side, skip non-ascending loops to stay simple.
      - If “N > i”: treat as “i < N”.
      - If “N >= i”: treat as “i <= N”.
    - Use EvaluateExprToInt to turn BoundE into an integer. If evaluation fails, skip the loop.

Step B. Collect arrays indexed by the induction variable inside the loop
- Traverse FS->getBody() and collect all ArraySubscriptExpr (ASE) whose index expression uses the induction variable Var. A quick check: findSpecificTypeInChildren<DeclRefExpr>(ASE->getIdx()) equals the Var’s Decl (or compare canonical declarations).
- For each matching ASE:
  - Extract the base expression BaseE: ASE->getBase()->IgnoreParenImpCasts().
  - Compute the compile-time size SizeOfBase for BaseE using a helper:
    - If BaseE is a DeclRefExpr to a VarDecl with ConstantArrayType: use getArraySizeFromExpr(ArraySize, BaseE). If returns true, SizeOfBase = ArraySize.getLimitedValue().
    - Else if BaseE is a MemberExpr (e.g., clock_table->DcfClocks): get the FieldDecl from the MemberExpr; if its type is ConstantArrayType, read the ConstantArrayType size from the type. Record that as SizeOfBase.
    - Else (pointer, unknown, VLA): mark size as unknown and skip this base (we only warn when we can prove the size).
  - Keep a map: BaseKey -> SizeOfBase, and record the ArraySubscriptExpr site for reporting. BaseKey can be the Decl (VarDecl or FieldDecl) of the array to deduplicate multiple uses of the same array.

Step C. Detect the mismatched parallel indexing pattern
- Heuristic to reduce false positives:
  - Require that there are at least two distinct arrays indexed by the same induction variable within the loop body (two distinct BaseKeys).
- For each collected array with known SizeOfBase:
  - If UpperBoundFromCondition > SizeOfBase, then the loop can drive the index beyond the array’s last valid index.
  - This exactly matches the target pattern when the loop is bounded by SIZE_A but is also indexing a smaller B.
- Optional refinement (not required, but further reduces FPs):
  - Ensure that at least one other array with the same index appears in the loop body (it may have unknown or larger size). This confirms the “parallel arrays” intent.
  - Optionally, detect a compare-use pattern (if (A[i] == key) ... B[i] ...) by scanning for a BinaryOperator ‘==’ where one side is an ASE with the same index Var; this is not mandatory for the warning.

Step D. Bug reporting
- For every offending array (where UpperBoundFromCondition > SizeOfBase), emit a BasicBugReport.
- Message: “Loop bound allows index up to N but also indexes array ‘X’ of size S.”
  - N is the computed upper bound.
  - X is the array name extracted from the DeclRefExpr or MemberExpr (use FieldDecl->getNameAsString() or VarDecl->getNameAsString()).
  - S is the compile-time array size.
- Point the report location to the ArraySubscriptExpr of the smaller array (the one that could be overflowed). Attach the source range of that ASE.
- Use C.getBugReporter().emitReport(std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>(...)).

3) Utilities usage notes
- EvaluateExprToInt: to evaluate the loop bound expression (macros like VG_NUM_SOC_VOLTAGE_LEVELS typically fold to integers).
- getArraySizeFromExpr: directly handles DeclRefExpr->VarDecl constant arrays.
- For MemberExpr (struct/union field arrays), manually read the ConstantArrayType from the FieldDecl’s type to obtain the size.
- findSpecificTypeInChildren: convenient to confirm the index expression actually references the loop variable.
- ExprHasName: optional, if you decide to further correlate macro names and field names to tighten the heuristic (not required for the core solution).

4) Summary of minimal logic
- Single callback: checkASTCodeBody.
- For each simple for-loop with i starting at 0 and i < Bound (or i <= Bound), evaluate Bound to an integer.
- Collect all arrays indexed with i; compute their compile-time sizes (DeclRefExpr or MemberExpr constant arrays).
- If at least two arrays are indexed with i and any one has size smaller than the computed bound, report at the subscript using the smaller array.
- Short message, precise location.
