## Bug Pattern

Iterating over one array using its size as the loop bound while indexing a second, smaller array with the same loop index, leading to out-of-bounds access of the smaller array.

Example pattern:
for (i = 0; i < SIZE_A; i++) {        // SIZE_A > SIZE_B
    if (A[i] == condition)
        return B[i];                   // B has only SIZE_B elements
}

Root cause: assuming two “parallel” arrays have identical lengths and using a single bound (SIZE_A) for both, instead of limiting iteration to min(SIZE_A, SIZE_B) or guarding accesses to the smaller array.
