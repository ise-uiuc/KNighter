## Bug Pattern

Allocating a kernel buffer with kmalloc() and then copying it to userspace (via copy_to_user) without guaranteeing that every byte in the copied region has been initialized. This leaves padding/tail bytes uninitialized, causing a kernel information leak. The fix is to zero-initialize the buffer (e.g., with kzalloc or memset) or ensure the entire copied size is explicitly initialized before copy_to_user.
