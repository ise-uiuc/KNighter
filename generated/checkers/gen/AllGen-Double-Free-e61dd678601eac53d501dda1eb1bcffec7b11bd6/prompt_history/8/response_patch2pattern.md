## Bug Pattern

Double free of a struct member due to redundant deallocation: a member pointer (ca->buckets_nouse) is explicitly kfree()'d in the top-level teardown function while another cleanup helper called in the same path (e.g., bch2_dev_buckets_free(ca)) also frees that same member. This duplicated ownership/cleanup leads to freeing the same memory twice.
