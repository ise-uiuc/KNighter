Plan

1. Program state
- Register two per-path sets to remember which device object (base) has had the specific member freed manually or by the higher-level cleanup:
  - REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(ManualFreedBucketsNouse, const MemRegion*)
  - REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(HighLevelFreedBucketsNouse, const MemRegion*)
- No other custom state (traits/maps) is needed. We only track whether the “ca” base object for ca->buckets_nouse was freed manually and/or via the high-level function.

2. Helper utilities
- isKfree(const CallEvent &Call): return true if callee identifier name is "kfree".
- isBucketsHLFree(const CallEvent &Call): return true if callee identifier name is "bch2_dev_buckets_free".
- getOwnerRegionIfMember(const Expr *Arg, StringRef MemberName, CheckerContext &C):
  - Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<MemberExpr>(Arg) to find a MemberExpr inside the call argument (after ignoring casts/implicits).
  - If found, check MemberExpr->getMemberDecl()->getName() equals MemberName ("buckets_nouse").
  - If matches, return getMemRegionFromExpr(MemberExpr->getBase(), C) to identify the owner object (“ca”).
  - Otherwise return nullptr.
- getArgBaseRegion(const CallEvent &Call, unsigned Idx, CheckerContext &C):
  - For bch2_dev_buckets_free(ca), return getMemRegionFromExpr(Call.getArgExpr(0), C).

3. Main detection logic in checkPreCall
- Goal: Report when both of these happen on the same base object region, in any order:
  - Manual free: kfree(ca->buckets_nouse)
  - High-level free: bch2_dev_buckets_free(ca)
- Steps:
  a) Handle high-level free call
     - If isBucketsHLFree(Call):
       - const MemRegion *Base = getArgBaseRegion(Call, 0, C); if !Base return.
       - ProgramStateRef State = C.getState();
       - If Base is in ManualFreedBucketsNouse set:
         - This path already manually freed ca->buckets_nouse; calling the HL free again yields a double free.
         - Generate a non-fatal error node and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message: "Double free of buckets_nouse".
       - Else:
         - Insert Base into HighLevelFreedBucketsNouse set and C.addTransition(NewState).
  b) Handle manual kfree of the specific member
     - If isKfree(Call):
       - const Expr *Arg = Call.getArgExpr(0);
       - const MemRegion *Base = getOwnerRegionIfMember(Arg, "buckets_nouse", C);
       - If !Base, return (we only care about ca->buckets_nouse).
       - ProgramStateRef State = C.getState();
       - If Base is in HighLevelFreedBucketsNouse set:
         - The HL free was already (or will be) invoked; freeing this member manually causes double free.
         - Report with message: "Double free of buckets_nouse".
       - Else:
         - Insert Base into ManualFreedBucketsNouse set and C.addTransition(NewState).

4. Reporting
- Use a single BugType member (lazy-initialized) with a clear, short name, for example: "Double free of member".
- At the second event on-path (either HL free follows manual free, or manual free follows HL free), build a non-fatal error node (generateNonFatalErrorNode). If null, return. Otherwise create PathSensitiveBugReport with:
  - Message: "Double free of buckets_nouse".
  - Location: the call expression of the second event (Call.getSourceRange()).
  - Emit via C.emitReport.

5. Optional cleanup
- checkEndFunction: no special cleanup required; per-path state will be dropped after function analysis. If desired, you can return a state with both sets cleared to avoid cross-function bleed, but CSA already scopes state to contexts.

6. Notes and scope control
- The checker is narrowly scoped to:
  - Manual free site: kfree(ca->buckets_nouse)
  - High-level cleanup: bch2_dev_buckets_free(ca)
- We intentionally avoid pointer alias analysis to keep it simple and precise. Only direct MemberExpr to "buckets_nouse" is flagged.
- The order is handled symmetrically: we report on whichever comes second along a path.
