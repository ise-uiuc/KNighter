## Bug Pattern

Using an unbounded string copy (strcpy) to copy a variable-length source into a fixed-size destination buffer in a struct, without checking or limiting the length of the copy, leading to potential buffer overflow.

Example:
- strcpy(di.name, hdev->name); where di.name is a small fixed array (e.g., char name[8]) and hdev->name may exceed that size.
