Plan

1. Program State
- Register one per-path map to remember variables that hold results of roundup_pow_of_two():
  - REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(RoundupResultMap, const MemRegion*, const Expr*)
  - Key: the MemRegion of the LHS variable.
  - Value: the argument expression (Expr*) passed to roundup_pow_of_two() when this variable was assigned. We only need this as a tag and optional context; storing the pointer is fine.

2. Callback Selection and Implementation

2.1 checkBind (capture assignments/initializations from roundup_pow_of_two)
- Goal: When a variable is bound to the result of roundup_pow_of_two(arg), record that the variable holds a rounded value.
- Steps:
  - If Loc.getAsRegion() is null, return.
  - From the statement S of this bind, search for a CallExpr in its children using findSpecificTypeInChildren<CallExpr>(S).
  - If no call found, or callee name is not exactly "roundup_pow_of_two", then:
    - Remove this region from RoundupResultMap (the variable is being overwritten with a non-rounded value).
    - Return.
  - If the call is to "roundup_pow_of_two":
    - Get the first argument expression ArgE = Call->getArg(0).
    - Insert/update RoundupResultMap[Region] = ArgE.
- Notes:
  - This handles both simple assignments and initializations (initializers also go through binding).
  - If multiple declarators exist in one DeclStmt, checkBind will be invoked per binding.

2.2 checkBranchCondition (detect “zero checks” of the rounded result)
- Goal: Warn when code checks the result of roundup_pow_of_two for zero (either directly or via a variable), which is the overflow check pattern that is unsafe on 32-bit arches.
- Steps:
  - Let Cond = Condition expression.
  - Canonicalize the predicate E being tested for zero:
    - If Cond is a UnaryOperator with opcode UO_LNot, then E = Cond->getSubExpr()->IgnoreParenImpCasts() and treat it as (E == 0).
    - Else if Cond is a BinaryOperator with opcode BO_EQ:
      - Identify if one side is integer constant 0 (use EvaluateExprToInt to check) and set E to the other side (IgnoreParenImpCasts()).
    - Otherwise, return (we only warn on explicit or negated zero checks).
  - Now classify E:
    1) Direct call case:
       - If E is (or contains) a CallExpr to roundup_pow_of_two (use findSpecificTypeInChildren<CallExpr>(E)):
         - If callee name == "roundup_pow_of_two", this is the target pattern. Report a bug.
    2) Variable case:
       - If E is a DeclRefExpr/MemberExpr/etc.:
         - Resolve its MemRegion via getMemRegionFromExpr(E, C).
         - If Region is in RoundupResultMap, then this variable is a roundup_pow_of_two result. Report a bug.
  - Reporting:
    - Generate a non-fatal error node and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a short message like:
      "Do not check roundup_pow_of_two(x) result for zero; validate x before calling (e.g., x > 1UL << 31)."
- Optional gating (if you want to reduce noise):
  - You may limit the report to platforms where unsigned long is 32-bit:
    - unsigned ULBits = C.getASTContext().getTypeSize(C.getASTContext().UnsignedLongTy);
    - Only emit if ULBits <= 32.
  - Otherwise, always emit since the pattern is fragile across 32-bit arches.

2.3 Optional: checkPostStmt(const DeclStmt*)
- This is not strictly necessary since checkBind will handle initializations, but if desired for robustness:
  - For each VarDecl with initializer:
    - If the initializer is a CallExpr to roundup_pow_of_two(), map the Var’s region into RoundupResultMap with the call argument.
  - This duplicates what checkBind already does; keep it out to stay simple.

3. Additional Details and Heuristics
- Callee name matching:
  - Use CallEvent/CallExpr callee identifier and compare string with "roundup_pow_of_two".
- Zero check detection:
  - Prefer explicit patterns:
    - if (!expr)            -> treat as expr == 0
    - if (expr == 0)
  - Ignore other comparisons (expr != 0, expr > 0, etc.) to avoid false positives; the bug pattern relies on using zero to detect overflow.
- Map maintenance:
  - In checkBind, if the LHS region is re-assigned from any non-roundup_pow_of_two source, remove it from the map.
- No alias tracking:
  - To keep it simple, do not track pointer/value aliases. This is acceptable because the kernel idiom is usually a direct assignment to a named variable that is then tested. If you want to extend later, you could add alias maps, but not required here.

4. Bug Type and Messages
- Create a BugType once (e.g., in the checker constructor) named:
  - "Unsafe overflow check of roundup_pow_of_two()"
- Report message (short and clear):
  - "roundup_pow_of_two() result checked for zero; check the input before calling (avoid UB on 32-bit)."

This minimal plan reliably flags the targeted bug pattern:
- It recognizes both direct-in-condition calls and variable-based checks.
- It stays simple with one program-state map and two callbacks.
