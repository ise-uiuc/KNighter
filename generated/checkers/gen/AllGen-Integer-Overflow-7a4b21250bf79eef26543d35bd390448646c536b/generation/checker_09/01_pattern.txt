## Bug Pattern

Relying on roundup_pow_of_two(x) to detect overflow (e.g., by checking the result for 0) while passing it an unbounded 32-bit value. On 32-bit arches, roundup_pow_of_two() may perform a left shift by BITS_PER_LONG (e.g., 1UL << 32), which is undefined behavior; thus the result is not guaranteed to become 0 and the overflow check can be bypassed.

Buggy pattern:
- n = roundup_pow_of_two(x);
- if (!n) // assume overflow
-   error;

Correct pattern:
- if (x > 1UL << (BITS_PER_LONG - 1)) // largest representable power-of-two
-   error;
- n = roundup_pow_of_two(x);
