1) Program state customizations

- REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(RoundupResMap, const MemRegion*, const Stmt*)
  - Purpose: mark scalar variables whose current value comes from roundup_pow_of_two(...). The mapped Stmt* can be the originating CallExpr (used only for diagnostics context; presence in map is the main signal).
  - We do not need alias tracking or other traits.

2) Callback functions and implementation steps

Step A — Track assignments/initializations from roundup_pow_of_two (checkBind)

- Hook: void checkBind(SVal Loc, SVal Val, const Stmt *S, CheckerContext &C) const
- Goal: whenever a variable is assigned or initialized with the result of roundup_pow_of_two(...), record that the variable currently stores a “rounded” value. If the variable is assigned something else later, clear the mark.

Implementation details:
- Early exits:
  - If Loc is not a region (Loc.getAsRegion() == nullptr), return.
  - Ignore non-scalar regions (but in practice a VarRegion is fine).
- Identify whether this bind comes from a call to roundup_pow_of_two:
  - Use findSpecificTypeInChildren<CallExpr>(S) to fetch a CallExpr within the binding Stmt (works for both initialization and assignment).
  - If no CallExpr is found, then this bind does not originate from a call; remove the region from RoundupResMap (to avoid stale marks) and return.
  - If a CallExpr CE is found:
    - Determine whether CE calls roundup_pow_of_two:
      - Prefer CE->getDirectCallee() and compare getNameAsString() == "roundup_pow_of_two".
      - If callee cannot be resolved (e.g., macro/inline), fall back to ExprHasName(CE, "roundup_pow_of_two", C).
    - If it is a roundup_pow_of_two call:
      - Add mapping: State = State->set<RoundupResMap>(Region, CE); C.addTransition(State).
    - Otherwise:
      - Remove any existing mapping for this region (clear stale info).
- Result: after this step, any variable currently holding the result of roundup_pow_of_two is tracked in RoundupResMap.

Step B — Detect unreliable zero-check on the rounded result (checkBranchCondition)

- Hook: void checkBranchCondition(const Stmt *Condition, CheckerContext &C) const
- Goal: catch if-statements like:
  - if (!n) where n is the result of roundup_pow_of_two(...)
  - if (n == 0) or if (0 == n) where n is the result of roundup_pow_of_two(...)
  - if (!roundup_pow_of_two(x)) or if (roundup_pow_of_two(x) == 0)
  These indicate the bad overflow check the patch fixes.
- Architecture guard:
  - Only report on 32-bit unsigned long targets, because the UB is specifically on 32-bit arches.
  - Determine with: C.getASTContext().getTypeSize(C.getASTContext().UnsignedLongTy) == 32 (bits). If not 32, return without reporting.

Implementation details:
- Extract the expression ECond = cast<Expr>(Condition)->IgnoreParenImpCasts() if possible; otherwise return.
- Pattern match three common forms to obtain a “checked expression” ECheck:
  1) UnaryOperator ‘!’:
     - If isa<UnaryOperator>(ECond) and getOpcode() == UO_LNot:
       - ECheck = getSubExpr()->IgnoreParenImpCasts().
  2) BinaryOperator ‘==’:
     - If isa<BinaryOperator>(ECond) and getOpcode() == BO_EQ:
       - Let L = LHS->IgnoreParenImpCasts(); R = RHS->IgnoreParenImpCasts().
       - If either side is an integer constant expression equal to 0, let ECheck be the other side.
  3) We deliberately ignore “if (n)” and “if (n != 0)” because they are not overflow checks, but “if (!n)” and “if (n == 0)” are typical overflow checks. Keeping the scope tight reduces false positives.
- Now decide if ECheck is a roundup_pow_of_two result:
  - Case A: ECheck is a CallExpr CE:
    - If CE is a call to roundup_pow_of_two (same name checks as in Step A), this is a match; report.
  - Case B: ECheck is a reference to a tracked variable:
    - Try to get the MemRegion: const MemRegion *R = getMemRegionFromExpr(ECheck, C).
    - If R != nullptr and RoundupResMap contains R, this is a match; report.
  - Otherwise, do nothing.
- Reporting:
  - Create a non-fatal error node and emit a PathSensitiveBugReport with a concise message, e.g.:
    - “Unreliable overflow check after roundup_pow_of_two(); validate input before rounding.”
  - Optionally attach a note to the saved CallExpr from RoundupResMap (if available) to point to where the rounded value was produced.

3) Helper routines to implement

- bool isRoundupPow2Call(const CallExpr *CE, CheckerContext &C)
  - Return true if CE->getDirectCallee() has name “roundup_pow_of_two”.
  - If unresolved, use ExprHasName(CE, "roundup_pow_of_two", C).
- bool isZeroConstant(const Expr *E, CheckerContext &C)
  - Use EvaluateExprToInt(APSInt, E, C) and check equals zero. If Evaluate fails, also check for IntegerLiteral(0).
- bool extractCheckedExpr(const Expr *Cond, const Expr* &ECheck, CheckerContext &C)
  - Implement the pattern matching described in Step B to extract ECheck from ‘!X’ or ‘X == 0’/‘0 == X’.

4) Why this suffices

- We only need to detect the pattern of using the rounded result as an overflow detector via zero check. Tracking the source variable via a small map is enough and avoids complex dataflow.
- Restricting to 32-bit unsigned long eliminates false positives on 64-bit targets where the behavior is well-defined.
- Catching both direct calls in the condition and checks on variables previously assigned from roundup_pow_of_two covers the common kernel patterns found in practice.

5) Bug report message

- Title: “Unreliable overflow check after roundup_pow_of_two()”
- Message: “roundup_pow_of_two() may overflow (UB) on 32-bit; check the input before rounding (e.g., x > 1UL << 31).”
