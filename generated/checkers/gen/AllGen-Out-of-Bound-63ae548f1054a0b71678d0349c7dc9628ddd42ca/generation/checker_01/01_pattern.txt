## Bug Pattern

Using a computed loop index to access fixed-size LUT arrays without bounds validation:
- Accessing output_tf->tf_pts.{red, green, blue}[i] where i is derived from start_index and increment, but not checked against TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.
- Example:
  rgb_resulted[j].red = output_tf->tf_pts.red[i];  // missing: if (i >= TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS) error

This leads to potential out-of-bounds reads when i >= TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.
