## Bug Pattern

Indexing a fixed-size lookup table (transfer function points) with a computed loop index without validating the index against the tableâ€™s size constant. Specifically, using i (derived from region-based start_index and increment) to access output_tf->tf_pts.{red,green,blue}[i] without checking i < TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, leading to potential out-of-bounds array access.
