## Bug Pattern

Indexing a fixed-size LUT array using a computed loop index without verifying it is within bounds:
- i is derived from region-based math (start_index and increment) and used to access output_tf->tf_pts.{red,green,blue}[i].
- The code only checks j against hw_points, but never checks i against TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS.
- This missing upper-bound check allows i to exceed TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS, causing out-of-bounds reads on the tf_pts arrays.
