## Bug Pattern

Performing a multiplication on operands of narrower or mixed integer types (e.g., u32 × u32, int × unsigned int) and then assigning/adding the result to a wider type (u64/dma_addr_t) without first promoting an operand to the wider type. This causes the multiplication to occur in the narrower type and potentially overflow before being widened, e.g.:

- args->size = args->pitch * args->height;        // u32 * u32 -> overflow before storing in u64
- addr += (src_x >> 16) * cpp;                     // int * u8/u32 -> overflow before adding to dma_addr_t
- addr += pitch * y_offset_in_blocks;              // u32 * int -> overflow before adding to dma_addr_t

Fix by ensuring the multiplication is done in a wide enough type (cast one operand or use a wide-typed accumulator first), e.g., size64 = (u64)pitch32 * height32; or size64 = pitch32; size64 *= height32.
