## Bug Pattern

Left-shifting a 32-bit expression and only widening to 64-bit after the shift, causing the shift to be performed in 32-bit width and overflow/truncation before assignment:

u64 tau4 = ((1 << x_w) | x) << y;   // shift happens in 32-bit -> overflow
// Correct:
u64 tau4 = (u64)((1 << x_w) | x) << y;

Root cause: the shift is evaluated in the type of the left operand (u32), so bits are lost when y or the result exceeds 32 bits; casting must occur before the shift.
