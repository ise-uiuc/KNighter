- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported cleanup in amdgpu_read_platform_bios() does not match the target bug pattern. Here, adev->bios is allocated locally via kzalloc(romlen, ...) before any jump to the shared error label. The two goto free_bios paths (ioremap failure and check_atom_bios() returning false) both occur only after this allocation succeeds, so kfree(adev->bios) frees memory owned by this function. The callee check_atom_bios() does not free the buffer; it only validates its contents and returns a bool (consistent with other uses in this file where callers free on failure). Even if a jump occurred before allocation (it doesnâ€™t), kfree(NULL) is safe. There is no scenario where a callee frees adev->bios leading to a double free, nor is there a path that frees an unallocated or foreign-owned resource. Therefore, this is a false positive relative to the specified bug pattern.
