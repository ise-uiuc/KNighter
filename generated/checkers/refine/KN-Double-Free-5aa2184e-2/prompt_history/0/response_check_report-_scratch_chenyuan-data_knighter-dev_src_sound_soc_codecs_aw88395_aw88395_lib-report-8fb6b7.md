- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged code frees a resource that is definitively owned by the function, not by a callee. In aw_dev_prof_parse_multi_bin(), aw_bin is allocated with devm_kzalloc() in this function, and on all exit paths (both success and error) it is released via devm_kfree() at the shared label. If allocation fails, the function returns early and never reaches the label, so there is no free of an uninitialized pointer. There is no evidence that the callee (aw_parsing_bin_file()) frees aw_bin; in fact, other functions in the same file follow the same pattern (allocate aw_bin, call aw_parsing_bin_file(), then devm_kfree() it), which would be unsafe if the callee freed it. Furthermore, devm_kfree() is the correct way to release devm-managed allocations early; it removes the resource from the devres list, preventing double-free at device teardown. This does not match the target bug pattern (freeing callee-managed/conditionally allocated memory via a shared error label leading to double free). The shared label here only frees memory allocated in this function and always owned by it, so there is no real bug and no match to the specified pattern.
