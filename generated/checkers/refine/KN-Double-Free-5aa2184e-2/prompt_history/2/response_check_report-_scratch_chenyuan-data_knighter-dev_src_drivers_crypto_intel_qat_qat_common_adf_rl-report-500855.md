- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported pattern does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug. In adf_rl_start(), accel_dev->rate_limiting is allocated in adf_rl_init() and its presence is checked at the start of adf_rl_start() (returning early via ret_err if NULL). On failure paths inside adf_rl_start(), the shared error label ret_free frees accel_dev->rate_limiting and sets it to NULL, which is appropriate since this function is unwinding initialization that relies on that pre-allocated structure. The intermediate cleanup calls (adf_sysfs_rl_rm, adf_rl_remove_sla_all) do not free accel_dev->rate_limiting. There is no callee-managed memory being freed twice, nor any function in the failure path that frees rate_limiting prior to ret_free. adf_rl_exit() also guards with a NULL check, so there is no double free even if exit is called after a failed start. Therefore, this is not the “unconditional cleanup freeing callee-managed/conditionally allocated memory” bug pattern; ownership of rate_limiting remains with this driver, and the free is safe.
