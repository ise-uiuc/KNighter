- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged free is kfree(efx->nic_data) in falcon_probe_nic(). This function itself allocates nic_data via kzalloc and immediately assigns it to efx->nic_data before any goto to the shared error labels. If allocation fails, it returns -ENOMEM directly, so the error labels are only reachable after efx->nic_data was allocated by this function. None of the called helpers in the failing paths free efx->nic_data, and there is no earlier kfree of this field in the function. Thus, the cleanup at the shared error label frees memory owned and allocated by this function exactly once.

This does not match the target bug pattern, which concerns freeing callee-managed or conditionally allocated memory unconditionally in a shared error path (leading to double free). Here, the memory is not callee-managed; it is always owned by the caller when the error labels are used. Therefore, the report is a false positive and not a real bug.
