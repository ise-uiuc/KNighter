## Bug Pattern

Unconditional cleanup via a shared error label frees resources that are not guaranteed to be allocated/owned at that point. Specifically, jumping to a label that does kfree(mt->fc) even when hws_definer_conv_match_params_to_hl() failed (and may have already freed or never allocated mt->fc) leads to a double free. The root cause is using a single error path to free callee-managed/conditionally allocated memory, instead of separating cleanup by resource lifetime and ownership.
