- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported pattern does not match the target bug pattern. In falcon_probe_nic(), efx->nic_data is allocated locally via kzalloc() and immediately stored into efx->nic_data. All error gotos (fail1..fail6) are only reachable after this allocation succeeds; if allocation fails, the function returns early and does not jump to the shared error label. No callee in the shown paths frees efx->nic_data. The cleanup sequence only frees other resources (irq_status buffer, i2c adapter, pci_dev2 ref) before finally kfree(efx->nic_data) at fail1. There is no code path that would double free or free an unowned efx->nic_data. This is standard, correct shared-error-path cleanup and does not exhibit the callee-managed/conditionally allocated free misuse described in the target bug pattern.
