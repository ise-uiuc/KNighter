Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags frees of param->field in shared error labels even when the field was allocated and assigned within the same function via an intermediate local variable. In the falcon_probe_nic example, nic_data = kzalloc(...); efx->nic_data = nic_data; ... fail1: kfree(efx->nic_data); is correct. Our current suppression only recognizes direct assignments param->field = AllocCall(...), not indirect ones via a local variable, and path-sensitive state sometimes cannot propagate ownership to the field.
- Fix: Extend the AST collector to:
  - Record assignments of allocator returns to local variables.
  - When later assigning that variable to a param->field, record this as an allocator-origin for the param->field as well (provided the allocator assignment to the variable precedes the field assignment).
  - This leverages the existing isFalsePositive heuristic that suppresses reports if param->field was assigned from an allocator within the same function before the free.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Only propagate allocator provenance from variables to fields if we actually saw the variable assigned from an allocator earlier in this function and before the field assignment.
  - We do not change the existing behavior for direct param->field = allocator(...) assignments.
  - We preserve detection of the target bug (mlx5hws_definer_calc_layout), which allocates/frees the field in a callee, not in the current function; thus the new suppression does not apply there.
  - Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility; no #include is removed.
