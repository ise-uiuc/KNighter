Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports when a shared error label frees a parameter field, regardless of whether this function is the one that allocated/owns that field along other control-flow paths. In the false positive (sctp_auth_init), the field is legitimately allocated in this function (inside guarded branches), then freed in the shared error label. Our checker already suppresses if it can confirm an allocation assignment occurred before the free along the same linear order, but the FP path assumed the allocation branch was not taken. We need a path-insensitive suppression for fields that are allocated anywhere in the function body (AST-level), even if not on the current symbolic path.
- Fixes:
  1) Add a new suppression: if the same param-field is ever assigned from an allocator anywhere in the current function (regardless of path or ordering), suppress the warning. This matches realistic ownership by this function and avoids the sctp false positive.
  2) Add an additional conservative suppression when the same param-field is set to NULL after the free (within the same function). This is a common cleanup idiom and not indicative of the target pattern. This does not affect the target mlx5 bug, which does not null out the freed field.
- Edge cases and regressions: The new suppressions are intraprocedural and conservative. They maintain detection of the mlx5 bug because mt->fc is not assigned from an allocator in the same function, nor is it set to NULL after free in the buggy code. They also help avoid over-reporting in legitimate cleanup code where this function owns the allocation or properly nullifies the field.
- Compatibility: No API-breaking changes; relies on existing visitors and state traits as in Clang-18.
