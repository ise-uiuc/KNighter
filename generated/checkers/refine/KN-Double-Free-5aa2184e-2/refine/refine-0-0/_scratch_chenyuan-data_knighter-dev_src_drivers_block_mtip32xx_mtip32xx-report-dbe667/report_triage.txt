- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported pattern does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug here. In mtip_hw_init(), the only unconditional free at the shared error label is kfree(dd->port). The function allocates dd->port locally (kzalloc_node) after the product-type check; the early goto out1 path occurs before any allocation, so dd->port remains NULL as driver_data is typically kzalloc’ed at probe. kfree(NULL) is safe (no-op). On later error paths (out3/out2), the code first deinitializes subresources (mtip_deinit_port(dd->port), mtip_dma_free(dd)) and then frees the port structure at out1—this respects ownership; those callees do not free dd->port itself. There is no callee that may conditionally free dd->port, so no double free risk from the shared label. Hence, this does not exhibit the target “freeing callee-managed memory via shared error label” bug.
