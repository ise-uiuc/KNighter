- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The target bug pattern involves freeing memory in a shared error path that may have been freed (or never allocated) by a failing callee, causing a double free. In this p54_parse_eeprom path, the resources freed at the shared error label (priv->iq_autocal, priv->output_limit, priv->curve_data, priv->rssi_db, priv->survey) are owned by this driver and are either:
  - Allocated by helper functions that do not free on failure (e.g., p54_convert_db() returns NULL without freeing; p54_convert_output_limits() returns errors before allocation or completes successfully after a single kmalloc), or
  - Left as NULL if never allocated. kfree(NULL) is safe in the kernel.

There is no evidence that any callee frees these fields on error, nor that these fields point to non-kmalloc memory at the time of the shared cleanup. Thus, the unconditional kfree calls at the error label do not create a double free scenario and do not match the specified bug pattern.
