Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any kfree of a struct field inside a shared error label when it cannot prove that the memory was allocated by the current function. In the p54 case, the freed fields belong to a local/driver-owned context (priv->...), and kfree(NULL) is safe; the ownership is internal to the function/module even if allocation happens through helper wrappers. The checker doesn’t distinguish between freeing a parameter’s field (which matches the target bug) and freeing a local/private context’s field (common Linux cleanup idiom), leading to a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1) Narrow the detection to the higher-risk scenario that matches the target bug pattern: only warn when the freed field belongs directly to a function parameter (e.g., mt->fc). This excludes local variables like priv->..., avoiding the p54 false positive while still catching the mlx5 bug (mt is a parameter).
  2) Keep and reuse existing suppressions: path-sensitive owned-region tracking, and per-function structural analysis to suppress labels where all gotos happen after local allocation assignments.
  3) Maintain compatibility with Clang-18 and keep all includes. No invasive API changes.
- Edge cases/regressions considered:
  - Using an alias of a parameter (e.g., T *local = param; kfree(local->f);) would no longer be flagged. The target buggy code uses direct parameter base (mt->fc), so detection remains intact.
  - Frees on shared labels for private state (priv->...) are common and usually safe; the new gating reduces false positives in such code.
  - Existing OwnedRegionSet logic still suppresses cases where the current function path-sensitively owns the region.
