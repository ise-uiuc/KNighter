Refinement Plan:
- Root cause:
  - The checker classifies any call whose source text contains “kfree” as free-like, which wrongly includes devm_kfree.
  - It assumes the freed pointer is always the first argument (index 0). For devm_kfree, the freed pointer is the second argument, and the first argument is aw_dev->dev (a member of a function parameter), causing the false positive.
- Fixes:
  - Replace substring-based free detection with exact callee-name matching and a small table that specifies which parameter indices are freed for each known free-like function.
  - Iterate over the correct freed-argument indices when analyzing a free-like call.
  - Pass the actual freed argument expression to isFalsePositive().
- Effects:
  - The false positive on devm_kfree(aw_dev->dev, aw_bin) is eliminated because the actual freed argument is aw_bin (a local variable), not a member of a parameter.
  - The original buggy pattern kfree(mt->fc) at a shared error label remains detected because kfree is recognized (index 0) and the freed expression is a MemberExpr of a function parameter (mt->fc), with no local ownership proven.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We use exact callee names for a controlled set: kfree, kvfree, vfree (index 0) and devm_kfree (index 1). This avoids accidental matches on wrappers. The target buggy code uses kfree, so detection is preserved.
  - Ownership state tracking and the earliest-local-allocation gating remain, suppressing warnings when the field is provably locally allocated before all gotos to the shared label.
  - No change to includes; compatible with Clang-18.
