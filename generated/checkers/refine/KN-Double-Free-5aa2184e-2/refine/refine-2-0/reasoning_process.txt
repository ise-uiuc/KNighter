Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reported a false positive when freeing a field owned by the current function because it only recognized ownership when the field was directly assigned from an allocator call. It missed the common idiom of assigning an allocator return to a local variable, then assigning that variable to a parameter field (e.g., nic_data = kzalloc(...); efx->nic_data = nic_data;).
- Fix:
  1. Extend the per-function AST visitor to track variables assigned from allocator calls (VarAllocLocs).
  2. When a parameter field is assigned from a variable that is known to have been assigned from an allocator earlier in the function, record this as if the field was directly assigned from an allocator (AllocAssignLocs).
  3. Leave the existing path-sensitive OwnedRegionSet as-is but rely on the new AST-based inference to suppress FPs when path-sensitive region matching is unavailable for the MemberExpr argument to free.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We only propagate allocator ownership when the source variable has a prior allocator assignment before the field assignment, avoiding over-suppression.
  - No suppression occurs when the field is only assigned by a callee (the target true-positive case), so the checker still flags the mlx5 definer bug.
  - Maintains Clang-18 API compatibility and retains all includes.
