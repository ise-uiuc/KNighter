Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any kfree-like call on a param-field in a shared error label without confirming whether that field is locally allocated within the same function. In the FP case, ae_uimage[i].page is allocated in this function via kzalloc and is owned by the function, but path-sensitive ownership tracking may not match due to array indices and region imprecision, so the current OwnedRegionSet heuristic fails, and the checker warns incorrectly.
- Fix: Add an AST-based suppression in isFalsePositive: if the same param-field (e.g., ae_uimage[].page) is assigned from an allocator call anywhere earlier in the function (before the free call), suppress the warning. This robustly handles array index imprecision and captures the common pattern of allocating and freeing within the same function.
- Ensure we keep detecting the mlx5 target bug: In the buggy mlx5 function, mt->fc is never assigned from a local allocator in that function; the new suppression will not trigger, and the checker will continue to report the issue.
- Edge cases and regressions: The suppression is guarded to only apply when we see an intrafunction allocator assignment to the exact param-field and only when it occurs before the free call location. This minimizes the risk of masking true positives. Existing ownership/path-sensitive checks and error-label heuristics remain intact.
- Compatibility: No breaking API changes. The solution relies on Clang-18-compatible APIs already included.
