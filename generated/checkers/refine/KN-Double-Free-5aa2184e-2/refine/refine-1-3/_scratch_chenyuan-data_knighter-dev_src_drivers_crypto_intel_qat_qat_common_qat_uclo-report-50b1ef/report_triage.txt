- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged code does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug. In qat_uclo_map_uimage(), the shared error label out_err only frees ae_uimage[i].page for i < j. For each prior iteration (0..j-1), ae_uimage[i].page was allocated in this function via kzalloc, and no callee frees it; thus the function owns these allocations and correctly frees them on error. If the failure occurs before allocating the current jâ€™s page (e.g., compatibility check fails), j remains unchanged and the loop frees only previously allocated pages. If allocation of page fails at index j, again only earlier pages (which were successfully allocated) are freed. The object handle struct is allocated with kzalloc, ensuring ae_uimage[] entries are initialized to NULL, so even in edge cases kfree(NULL) would be safe. There is no callee-managed memory being freed here, and no double-free: other cleanup paths either free these pages only on success paths later, or, on parse failure, the function returning error ensures pages are either already freed here or freed exactly once in later, separate cleanup. This differs from the target pattern (freeing possibly callee-freed/unallocated memory via a shared error label), so the report is a false positive.
