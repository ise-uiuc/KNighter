Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only recognized ownership when a field was assigned from a known allocator (kmalloc family). In fsverity_init_merkle_tree_params(), the field params->hashstate is assigned from fsverity_prepare_hash_state(), which is not in the allocator list. Thus the checker failed to recognize local ownership and flagged an unconditional free in a shared error label as a double-free risk, even though the function owns the memory and handles NULL safely.
- Fix: Track fields of function parameters that are assigned the result of any function call within the current function (not only known allocators). Use the earliest assignment location to decide whether all incoming gotos to the shared label occur after the field ownership is established; if yes, suppress the warning. This preserves detection of the target buggy code because in that case the field (mt->fc) is not assigned in the current function at all.
- Additional safeguards:
  - Keep existing gates requiring a shared label and “error-ish” label/goto.
  - Keep path-sensitive suppression when the freed value is definitely NULL.
  - Preserve OwnedRegionSet based on known allocators where applicable.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - This change suppresses warnings when a parameter’s field is assigned from any call in the same function, even if that call returns a borrowed pointer. This is acceptable for this checker because the target pattern is about double free via shared error labels caused by callee-managed allocation; when the assignment happens locally, this particular pattern is less relevant. Other checkers should catch mismatched frees of borrowed pointers.
- API stability: The patch keeps compatibility with Clang-18 API, does not remove includes, and only adds logic within the checker.
