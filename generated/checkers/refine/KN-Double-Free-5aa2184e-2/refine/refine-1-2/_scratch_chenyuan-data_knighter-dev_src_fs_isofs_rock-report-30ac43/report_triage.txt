- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged pattern does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug. In rock_continue(), rs->buffer is intentionally freed at the start to release any previous continuation buffer (kfree + NULL). If a new continuation is needed, a fresh buffer is kmalloc’d. On error paths (including the CE loop-limit case), the function jumps to the shared out label, which frees the currently owned buffer once. There is no double free of the same pointer: the first kfree is for the previous buffer (then rs->buffer is set to NULL), and if a new buffer was allocated, the final kfree at out frees that new allocation exactly once. If no new allocation occurred, kfree(NULL) is a no-op. Moreover, the caller’s cleanup does not double-free either: when rock_continue() returns an error (ret < 0), the caller goes to fail (not its out label), so it does not free rs.buffer again. This is unlike the target bug pattern where a shared error label frees memory that may be callee-managed or already freed; here the ownership and lifetime of rs->buffer are correctly managed within rock_continue(), and the cleanup is safe.
