Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any kfree of a parameter’s field in a shared label that looks error-like, but it doesn’t recognize a common, safe kernel pattern: the function explicitly resets the field’s lifetime by freeing a previous buffer and setting it to NULL before allocating a new one. A later shared-label kfree then correctly frees the new allocation. In rock_continue(), rs->buffer is freed and set to NULL early, then possibly reallocated; the final shared-label free is safe and not a double free.
- Fix approach:
  1. Keep the current detection for the mlx5 target pattern (freeing a callee-managed/conditionally allocated parameter field in a shared error label).
  2. Add AST-based false-positive suppression for the “reset-and-reallocate” idiom:
     - Collect, per function, per (parameter, field):
       - source locations of free-like calls on that field,
       - source locations of explicit nullifications (field = NULL/0),
       - source locations where the field is assigned from allocator-like calls.
     - Suppress the warning if there exists a prior free followed by a nullification and then a re-assignment from an allocator before the current free. This captures the lifetime reset and reallocation pattern.
  3. Retain existing path-sensitive suppression via OwnedRegionSet (if the analyzer proves the field points to an allocated symbol on this path).
  4. Retain error-label gating to reduce noise.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Only suppress when we see all three in order: free -> nullification -> allocator-assignment -> current free. This keeps real issues detectable, including the mlx5 case (which lacks the earlier free+NULL reset).
  - The suppression is keyed by both the parameter object and the field, avoiding conflation between different objects with the same struct field.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Only uses stable Static Analyzer APIs; no includes removed.
