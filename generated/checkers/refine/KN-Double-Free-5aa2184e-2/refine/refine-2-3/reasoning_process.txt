Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports a false positive on kfree(accel_dev->rate_limiting) inside a shared error label because its current suppression logic relies on a per-function map (NullSetLocs) for "field = NULL" assignments. In certain AST shapes or collection failures, this map can miss an immediate post-label nullification like accel_dev->rate_limiting = NULL; even though it appears right after the kfree. The checker then concludes the field is "unowned" within the function and warns, despite the canonical and safe kernel idiom: free followed by setting to NULL at the error label for device-private state.
- Fix: Add a robust, local AST-based suppression: if the free is in a label, and the next one or two statements after that label immediately nullify the same param->field, then suppress the warning. This mirrors a standard and safe cleanup idiom and addresses the specific false positive in adf_rl_start().
- Maintain detection of true positives: The target buggy code (mlx5hws_definer_calc_layout) does not nullify the field after the unconditional free; therefore, the new suppression does not silence that bug. All other gates remain intact.
- Edge cases/regressions: The new suppression is narrowly scoped to immediate post-label nullification of the exact same param->field. It will not suppress cases where a callee frees the resource earlier (the target bug), because those typically lack the immediate nullification at the label. Existing path-sensitive ownership and allocator-assignment suppressions remain in place. The change is compatible with Clang-18 since it only uses AST traversal and provided helper utilities.
