Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any kfree-like call that frees a parameter’s field inside a shared label (>=2 gotos), regardless of whether that label actually represents an error path. In dm-log-writes.c, the label “out” is a normal completion path (not an error label), and freeing block->data is correct. The checker lacked a notion of “errorish” labels/goto sites and did not distinguish between normal “out” labels and error cleanups.
- Fix: Add a robust gating heuristic that only warns when the enclosing label is on an “error-ish” path. Concretely, require that at least one incoming goto to the label is guarded by an error-like condition (e.g., if (ret), if (ret < 0), IS_ERR(), unlikely(ret), etc.) or that the label name itself looks like an error label (err, error, fail, free_, cleanup, out_err, etc.). Keep the existing gating that the freed member must belong to a function parameter (e.g., mt->fc), and retain the path-sensitive ownership suppressions.
- Edge cases and regressions: The mlx5 target buggy code uses gotos from if (ret) to a free_* label, so it still satisfies the new “errorish” gating and will continue to be reported. Normal “out” labels without errorish gotos (like in dm-log-writes.c) will be suppressed, eliminating the false positive.
- Compatibility: The solution uses Clang-18 APIs and the provided utility functions. No includes are removed.
