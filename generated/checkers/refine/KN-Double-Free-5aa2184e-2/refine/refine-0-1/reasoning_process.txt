Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker warns whenever a field is freed in a shared error label, unless it can prove ownership on the current path or it sees a field ever assigned from an allocator anywhere in the function (path-insensitive). In the AMD false positive, adev->bios is allocated in the same function unconditionally before all gotos to the shared label, but the checker failed to suppress because the ownership tracking can miss the path-sensitive bind, and the coarse “ever assigned by allocator” suppression is both too weak (may not fire due to analysis ordering) and too broad (risks hiding real bugs when there are early gotos before the assignment).
- Fix: Strengthen the suppression by correlating the shared label’s incoming gotos with the earliest in-function allocator assignment to that field. Specifically, suppress the warning when, for the freed field, every goto targeting the label lexically occurs after the earliest allocator assignment to that field in the same function. This preserves detection of the mlx5 bug (where the field is not assigned by allocator in the function) and suppresses the AMD false positive (all gotos are after kzalloc assignment).
- Implementation details:
  - Collect per-function:
    - Incoming goto statements per label (not just counts).
    - Earliest SourceLocation where a field is assigned from a known allocator.
  - In isFalsePositive, in addition to the existing “NULL free” and path-sensitive OwnedRegionSet checks, add the new “all gotos after earliest alloc” suppression.
  - Keep existing state tracking for ownership via AllocSymSet and OwnedRegionSet (Clang-18 API compliant).
  - Do not remove includes; only add logic and small data structures.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - If any goto targets the label before the earliest allocator assignment, we do not suppress, so real bugs are still reported.
  - If there is no in-function allocator assignment for the freed field, no suppression applies (mlx5 buggy code still detected).
  - Macro expansions are handled using SourceManager::isBeforeInTranslationUnit; if location ordering is unavailable, the suppression won’t trigger, erring on the safe side.
