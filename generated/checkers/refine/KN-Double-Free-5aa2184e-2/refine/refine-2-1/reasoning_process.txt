Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker’s heuristic was too broad: it flagged any free-like call at a shared error label when freeing a parameter’s field. This mismatched Linux’s vmalloc error-flow idiom, where vfree(param->addr) is the correct cleanup at a shared label, even though the memory wasn’t allocated in the same function. In the reported FP, the call was vfree(area->addr) at the fail label, a valid cleanup.
- Key fix: Narrow the class of “free-like” functions we consider to heap-free routines relevant to the target bug (kfree/kvfree/devm_kfree) and exclude vfree entirely. The mlx5 bug uses kfree(mt->fc), so detection remains intact; excluding vfree eliminates the mm/vmalloc.c FP.
- Maintain and leverage existing suppressions: ownership state tracking (OwnedRegionSet), intrafunction allocator assignment tracking, and “reset + reallocate” idiom suppression remain in place to avoid other FPs.
- Edge cases and regressions: Excluding vfree may skip issues that specifically involve vfree in shared error labels. This is an acceptable tradeoff for this checker because the target real bug pattern is kfree on a parameter field in a shared label. Detection of the provided mlx5 code remains unaffected.
- Clang-18 compatibility: No API changes; only local logic adjustment.
