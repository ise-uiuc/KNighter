Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats Linux logging helpers (dev_err/printk/pr_*) as dereference sinks when format contains %s. In the kernel, these are NULL-tolerant and print "(null)" without dereferencing, and similarly, misc_register tolerates ->name being NULL. This led to a false positive in ipmb_dev_int.c where devm_kasprintf() result was assigned to miscdev.name and misc_register was called.
- Fix: Stop treating kernel logging calls as dereference sinks and add a whitelist of NULL-tolerant sinks (e.g., dev_err/printk/pr_* and misc_register). Keep tracking the devm_kasprintf return symbol and continue reporting when it flows into real dereference sinks such as ice_ptp_auxbus_create_id_table or C string functions (strlen, strcmp, etc.). Maintain branch-based NULL checks.
- Edge cases: Ensure we still detect the real bug in ice_ptp_register_auxbus_driver via the modeling of ice_ptp_auxbus_create_id_table. Avoid regressions by keeping real dereference sinks and condition tracking, and not removing any includes. Maintain API compatibility with Clang-18.
