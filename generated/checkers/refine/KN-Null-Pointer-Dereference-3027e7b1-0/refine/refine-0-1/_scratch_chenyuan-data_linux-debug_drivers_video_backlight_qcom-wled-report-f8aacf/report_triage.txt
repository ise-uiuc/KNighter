- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: Although devm_kasprintf() can return NULL, the reported code only assigns the result to wled->name and does not immediately dereference or pass it to any helper/logging call in the shown context. The next statement is a switch on wled->version, which does not use wled->name. The target bug pattern requires immediate use that could dereference the NULL (e.g., passing to a function or logging), which is not demonstrated here. Also, the "%pOFn" formatting uses dev->of_node, which is effectively validated earlier via of_get_address(); if dev->of_node were NULL, the function would have returned -EINVAL before reaching devm_kasprintf(). Without evidence of an immediate dereference or use of wled->name following the allocation, this report does not match the target bug pattern and is a false positive.
