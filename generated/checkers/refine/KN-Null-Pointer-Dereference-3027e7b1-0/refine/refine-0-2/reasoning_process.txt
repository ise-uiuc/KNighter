Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker sometimes fails to recognize that the devm_kasprintf return value has been NULL-checked (e.g., if (!ptr) return ...), especially in wrapper conditions (likely/unlikely/IS_ERR_OR_NULL), leading to a false positive even when a proper check exists. It may also propagate stale symbol-to-region bindings on reassignment, and it over-approximates dereferences for logging functions by treating all varargs as dereferenced as soon as "%s" appears in the format.
- Fixes:
  1) Improve branch-condition handling:
     - Strip common wrapper calls such as likely/unlikely and handle IS_ERR/IS_ERR_OR_NULL to mark the pointer as checked.
     - Robustly strip parens/implicit casts/cleanups.
  2) Improve binding logic:
     - Clear Region2SymMap when a tracked region is assigned a non-symbol value (e.g., constant, string literal), to avoid stale associations.
  3) Reduce logging FPs:
     - Only consider as dereferenced as many arguments as the number of "%s" specifiers in a literal format string (instead of all varargs).
  4) Keep tracking logic and detection of the original buggy pattern intact:
     - Continue marking the devm_kasprintf return symbol as possibly null and unchecked.
     - Continue reporting on passes to known dereference sites, especially ice_ptp_auxbus_create_id_table and logging with "%s".
- Edge cases considered:
  - likely/unlikely wrappers, IS_ERR/IS_ERR_OR_NULL checks.
  - Reassignment to non-symbol values.
  - Multiple logs where only some args correspond to "%s".
- Compatibility: Code uses Clang-18 APIs and keeps all existing includes.
