- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code already performs the required NULL-check after devm_kasprintf. Specifically, divider_name is assigned from devm_kasprintf(), and immediately afterward the code checks if (!divider_name) return NULL; before any use. Only after this check is divider_name used to initialize init.name. This does not match the target bug pattern (missing NULL-check after devm_kasprintf) and does not present a real NULL dereference risk.
