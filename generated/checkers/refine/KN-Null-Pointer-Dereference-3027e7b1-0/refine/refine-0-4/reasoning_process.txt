Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker conflates loading a tracked pointer value through a double pointer (e.g., "*out = p") with dereferencing the tracked pointer itself (e.g., "*p" or "p[i]"). This happens because we use Region2SymMap in checkLocation to recover a tracked SymbolRef from the region of the base expression being dereferenced, which in double-pointer cases points to the storage holding the tracked pointer, not the tracked pointer itself. The checker then mistakenly reports a dereference even when the tracked pointer is immediately NULL-checked.
- Fix 1: In checkLocation, only report a dereference when the base expression being dereferenced (PtrE) has exactly one level of indirection (pointer depth == 1). This excludes cases such as "*char**" where the load only reads the pointer value (and is not a dereference of the tracked pointer).
- Fix 2: Make isDevmKasprintf match the callee by identifier name (getCalleeIdentifier) instead of substring search with ExprHasName to avoid spurious matches.
- Fix 3: Keep Region2SymMap propagation for arguments and checks (checkPreCall/checkBranchCondition), but avoid using Region2SymMap in a way that causes the double-pointer deref misinterpretation in checkLocation.
- Edge cases: The refinement still detects real dereferences like name[i] or *name for char* as intended. Passing the tracked pointer to functions known to dereference (e.g., ice_ptp_auxbus_create_id_table) and logging with literal formats containing %s is still caught. It will not report when only storing the pointer via an out-parameter or when the pointer is immediately NULL-checked.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs only; no includes removed.
