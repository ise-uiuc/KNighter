- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged path goes through fixup_tplg_name(), which calls devm_kasprintf() and returns the pointer. The caller, dmic_detect_topology_fixup(), immediately checks the returned pointer for NULL:
  - fixed_tplg_filename = fixup_tplg_name(...);
  - if (!fixed_tplg_filename) return -ENOMEM;
  - *tplg_filename = fixed_tplg_filename;
  This satisfies the target bug patternâ€™s requirement for a NULL-check before use. There is no dereference or use of the devm_kasprintf() result without a prior NULL-check. The dereference shown (*tplg_filename = ...) is of the caller-provided double pointer, not the allocation result, and the result itself is only assigned after the NULL-check. Therefore, the report does not match the target pattern and does not represent a real bug.
