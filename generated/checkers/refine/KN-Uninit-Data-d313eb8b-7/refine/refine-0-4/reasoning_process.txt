Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker relies on a broad heuristic (non-zeroing init-list) and an imprecise padding detector. It inadvertently classifies tc_u32_mark as having padding and flags a false positive when exporting it via nla_put. Also, the checker misses the target bug pattern in act_skbmod.c where there is no initializer at all.
- Fixes:
  1) Make padding detection precise and robust:
     - Use ASTRecordLayout with field indices.
     - Convert sizes to bits via ASTContext::toBits, not hard-coded 8x.
     - Handle flexible array members (ignore tail padding due to FAM).
  2) Change the state tracking model:
     - Track local, padded aggregates that might contain uninitialized bytes (either because there is no initializer or the initializer is not a full zeroing initializer).
     - Clear this state only when a full zeroing write (memset/memzero_explicit/bzero over the whole var) is seen.
     - Warn on export only when the type actually has padding and the variable is still marked “suspect.”
  3) Keep ZeroCleared set to short-circuit safe cases.
  4) Continue to detect the original buggy pattern (uninitialized local padded struct exported with sizeof(var)) by marking such variables as suspect on declaration if not zero-initialized.

- Edge cases:
  - Unions are always considered as having implicit padding/overlap.
  - Packed/FAM structs handled by layout queries.
  - Only warn when the exported length covers the whole object.
  - Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility and do not remove any includes.
