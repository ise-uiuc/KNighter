- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported spot exports a stack-allocated struct (tc_matchall_pcnt) via nla_put_64bit. However, the struct is declared as "struct tc_matchall_pcnt gpf = {};", which zero-initializes the entire object at allocation time. This prevents any uninitialized padding bytes from containing stack garbage. Although only gpf.rhit is subsequently updated, the rest of the struct (including any padding) remains zero. Therefore, the code does not exhibit the target pattern of copying a partially initialized, padded struct to user space. There is no real information leak here, and no matching pre-/post-patch fix pattern applies.
