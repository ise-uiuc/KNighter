Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker relies solely on path-sensitive state (ZeroCleared) set at DeclStmt to recognize brace-zero-initialized aggregates (e.g., struct S s = {};). On some paths, the DeclStmt state may not be available at the export call or not recorded due to syntactic/visitation quirks, leading to a warning even though the aggregate is fully zero-initialized and safe. In the reported false positive, struct tc_matchall_pcnt gpf = {}; is brace-zero-initialized, so exporting it cannot leak padding.
- Fixes:
  - Add a robust AST-based safety guard that directly inspects the VarDecl’s initializer and treats “{}” and “{0}” as zero-initialization, regardless of path-sensitive state.
  - Strengthen callee-name matching for nla_put and nla_put_64bit, and for zeroing APIs, to use CallEvent’s callee identifier first, with a fallback to source text only if necessary. This reduces spurious matches.
  - Keep existing state tracking (ZeroCleared and PartiallyInitAgg) to preserve detection of true positives (such as the target buggy code with partial designated initialization).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We consider only exact zero-brace constructs as safe; designated initializers and non-zeroing initializers are still treated as risky.
  - We still require: type has implicit padding, size covers the whole object, and a known user export helper is used, before warning; plus we only warn when there’s evidence of partial initialization.
  - Maintains Clang-18 compatibility and preserves detection of the tc_skbmod case.
