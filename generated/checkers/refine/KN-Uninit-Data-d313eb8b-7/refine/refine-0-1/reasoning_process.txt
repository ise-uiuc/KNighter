Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker misclassified a non-padded struct (tc_gred_sopt) as having implicit padding. This marked the variable as PartiallyInitAgg and caused a warning at the nla_put call, even though the struct’s layout has no holes.
- Fix approach:
  1. Reimplement hasImplicitPadding using ASTRecordLayout’s DataSize vs Size and detect inter-field gaps robustly. Recurse into nested records and array element types.
  2. Keep existing state tracking (PartiallyInitAgg and ZeroCleared). Only warn if:
     - the struct truly has padding, and
     - length covers the entire object, and
     - the object was not zero-cleared, and
     - there is evidence of non-zeroing aggregate initialization.
  3. Maintain detection of the target buggy pattern (tc_skbmod opt) by still flagging any padded struct that’s exported after field-wise initialization without prior zeroing.
  4. Avoid regressions by preserving all existing includes and APIs and keeping zeroing detection (memset/memzero_explicit/bzero) and netlink export detection intact.
  5. Add array element recursion to detect padding in nested arrays-of-structs.
