Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker’s padding detection was too conservative and could misclassify a no-padding struct as padded, which caused a false positive when a partially designated initializer was followed by a safe nla_put of a struct that actually has no holes (tc_vlan).
- Fixes:
  1) Rework hasImplicitPadding to use precise bit-level coverage with ASTRecordLayout, instead of the previous “any bitfield”/PrevEnd heuristic. This computes actual gaps between the end of one field and the start of the next, and detects tail padding, avoiding spurious classification.
  2) Keep existing guards:
     - Only warn when we can prove the type has padding.
     - Suppress warnings for variables proven zeroed via brace-zero-init or an explicit zeroing call.
  3) Maintain state tracking for partially initialized aggregates through existing ProgramState maps; do not warn unless the type is padded and we observed a non-zeroing init-list.
- Edge cases and regressions considered:
  - Bitfields: We now detect real holes using offsets and bit widths; we no longer blanket-return-true just because a bitfield exists. This reduces false positives while still flagging real gaps/tail padding created by bitfield layout.
  - Unions: Kept conservative behavior (warn) because exporting the entire union object may copy bytes that were never initialized on the active variant.
  - Nested records and arrays of records: We recurse into nested records to detect their padding, avoiding masking true positives like tcf_skbmod; arrays are unwrapped to their element types.
  - Compatibility: Uses stable Clang-18 APIs (ASTRecordLayout, FieldDecl bitwidth, etc.).
- The checker still flags the target buggy pattern (tcf_skbmod_dump) because the struct has a 4-byte hole; the refined padding detection will still detect it.
