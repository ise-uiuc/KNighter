- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported site exports a stack struct tc_vlan via nla_put(skb, ..., sizeof(opt), &opt). However, tc_vlan (from UAPI) is composed of six 32-bit fields laid out contiguously:
  - tc_gen expands to: __u32 index; __u32 capab; int action; int refcnt; int bindcnt;
  - followed by v_action (int or __u32)
  This layout yields 6 x 4-byte members with 4-byte alignment and no implicit padding/holes either between members or at the end on common ABIs. In the function, opt is initialized with a designated initializer setting index, refcnt, and bindcnt; per C rules, all unspecified members (e.g., capab) are zero-initialized. The code then explicitly sets action and v_action. Therefore, all bytes of the struct are defined before being copied; there are no padding bytes to leak. The reported issue does not match the target bug pattern (no padded struct bytes left uninitialized), and thus is a false positive.
