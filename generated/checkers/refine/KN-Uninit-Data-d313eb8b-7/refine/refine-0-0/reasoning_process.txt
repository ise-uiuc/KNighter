Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports when a local aggregate initialized with a non-zeroing initializer list is copied out via nla_put(), regardless of whether the struct actually has implicit padding. In the false positive, struct tc_red_qopt has no implicit padding, so copying it cannot leak stack bytes even if it wasn't explicitly zeroed.
- Fix: Introduce a robust structural check that detects whether the record type has implicit padding or tail padding using ASTRecordLayout. Only track/report partially initialized aggregates for record types that actually have implicit padding. Also gate the emission of a report on this condition.
- Edge cases:
  - Treat unions and bitfields conservatively as having potential padding to avoid missing real leaks.
  - Respect packed attributes via the AST layout.
  - Keep zero-brace initialization and explicit zeroing via memset/memzero_explicit/bzero as safe.
- Regressions: Minimizing false negatives/positives by:
  - Not marking PartiallyInitAgg for non-padded aggregates.
  - Re-checking padding presence before reporting.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Use ASTContext.getASTRecordLayout and existing APIs only. No includes were removed.
