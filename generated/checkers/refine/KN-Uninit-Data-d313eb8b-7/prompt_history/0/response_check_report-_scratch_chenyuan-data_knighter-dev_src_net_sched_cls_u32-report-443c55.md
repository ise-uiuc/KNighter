- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning flags a potential leak of uninitialized padding when copying a stack struct to user space. Here, the struct is tc_u32_mark, defined in UAPI as three 32-bit fields:
  - __u32 val;
  - __u32 mask;
  - __u32 success;

  This layout has no internal padding and no tail padding beyond 12 bytes on typical ABIs (alignment of __u32 is 4). In the code, all fields are explicitly initialized via a designated initializer, and success is further updated. The nla_put() uses sizeof(mark), which corresponds to the fully defined 12-byte struct with no holes. Therefore, there are no uninitialized padding bytes to leak, and the case does not match the target bug pattern of copying a partially initialized padded struct to user space.
