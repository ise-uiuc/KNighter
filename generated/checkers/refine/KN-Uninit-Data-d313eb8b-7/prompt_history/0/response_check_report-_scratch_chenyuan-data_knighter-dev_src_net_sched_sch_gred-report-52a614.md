- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported site constructs a struct tc_gred_sopt on the stack and initializes all of its fields via a designated initializer:
  - .DPs = table->DPs
  - .def_DP = table->def
  - .grio = gred_rio_mode(table)
  - .flags = table->red_flags
  In the UAPI, tc_gred_sopt consists of exactly these four fields, all 32-bit (u32) values, making sizeof(struct tc_gred_sopt) 16 bytes with no implicit padding. Since all members are fully initialized and there is no padding to carry uninitialized data, the nla_put(..., sizeof(sopt), &sopt) does not leak stack contents. This does not match the target bug pattern of exporting a partially initialized, padded struct to user space.
