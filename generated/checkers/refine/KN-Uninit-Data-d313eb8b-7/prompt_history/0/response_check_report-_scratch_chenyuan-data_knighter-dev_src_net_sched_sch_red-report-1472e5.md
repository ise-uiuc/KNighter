- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported site copies a stack-allocated struct tc_red_qopt to a netlink skb. However, tc_red_qopt is fully initialized and has no implicit padding holes that could leak stack data. Its UAPI definition is:
  - __u32 limit
  - __u32 qth_min
  - __u32 qth_max
  - __u8 Wlog
  - __u8 Plog
  - __u8 Scell_log
  - __u8 flags
  This layout totals 16 bytes (12 + 4), aligned to 4 bytes, with no internal padding and no tail padding needed. In red_dump(), all fields are explicitly initialized via a designated initializer before nla_put() is called:
  - limit, qth_min, qth_max, Wlog, Plog, Scell_log, and flags are all set.
  Therefore, there is neither partial initialization nor any padding bytes to leak. The case does not match the target bug pattern (no uninitialized padding exists and all fields are set), and there is no real bug to fix.
