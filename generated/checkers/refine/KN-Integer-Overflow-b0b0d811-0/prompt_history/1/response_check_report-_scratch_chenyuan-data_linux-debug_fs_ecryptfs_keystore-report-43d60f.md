- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged line computes a two-byte OpenPGP-style length: size = (data[0] - 192) * 256; size += data[1] + 192; The control flow ensures 192 <= data[0] < 224 (since the previous branch data[0] < 192 is false and this branch data[0] < 224 is true). Therefore, (data[0] - 192) ∈ [0, 31], and the product (data[0] - 192) * 256 ∈ [0, 7936]. Adding data[1] + 192 contributes at most 447, so the final size ∈ [192, 8383]. The multiplication occurs in int due to usual integer promotions (unsigned char -> int), but the maximum product (7936) is far below any 32-bit int limit and any size_t width (32- or 64-bit). There is no possibility of overflow before widening; thus it does not match the target bug pattern, which requires a potentially overflowing narrow-type multiplication before assignment to a wider type.
