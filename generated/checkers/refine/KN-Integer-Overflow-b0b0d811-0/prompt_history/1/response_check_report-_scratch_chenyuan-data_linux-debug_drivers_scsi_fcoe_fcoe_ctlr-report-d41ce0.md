- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged line computes dlen = desc->fip_dlen * FIP_BPW. Here, desc->fip_dlen is an 8-bit length field (u8) measured in 4-byte words (FIP_BPW is 4). Due to integer promotions, the multiplication occurs in int with a hard upper bound of 255 * 4 = 1020, which cannot overflow int. The result is then assigned to size_t (32- or 64-bit), so there is no risk of overflow-before-widening. This does not match the target bug pattern (narrow Ã— narrow potentially overflowing before assignment to a wider u64/dma_addr_t). Additionally, the code validates dlen against both a minimum descriptor size and the remaining record length (rlen), further ensuring correctness.
