- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged line assigns a 64-bit MSR value to m->synd via m->synd = mce_rdmsrl(MSR_AMD64_SMCA_MCx_SYND(i));. There is no multiplication in this assignment. The only potential multiplication is inside the MSR_AMD64_SMCA_MCx_SYND(i) macro, which computes the MSR index (a 32-bit value) as a base plus i times a small stride. That product is used as a 32-bit function argument to mce_rdmsrl and is not widened/assigned to a 64-bit data value. Furthermore, i is the MCA bank index, bounded by the number of banks (typically <= 64), and the stride is small (e.g., 0x10/0x20/0x40), so no overflow is feasible in 32-bit arithmetic. This does not match the target bug pattern of performing a narrow-type multiplication whose result is then assigned or added to a wider type (e.g., u64/dma_addr_t) causing overflow before widening. Hence, this is a false positive.
