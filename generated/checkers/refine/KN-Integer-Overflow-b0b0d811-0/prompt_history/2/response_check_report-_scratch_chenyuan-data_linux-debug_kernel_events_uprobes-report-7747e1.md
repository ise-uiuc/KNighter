- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: Although the expression has the “shape” of the target pattern (int × constant added to an unsigned long), the multiplication cannot overflow in its narrower type due to tight bounds:
  - slot_nr is obtained from find_first_zero_bit(area->bitmap, UINSNS_PER_PAGE) and further constrained by the loop logic, so on the successful path slot_nr ∈ [0, UINSNS_PER_PAGE-1].
  - UINSNS_PER_PAGE = PAGE_SIZE / UPROBE_XOL_SLOT_BYTES. Therefore, slot_nr * UPROBE_XOL_SLOT_BYTES ≤ (UINSNS_PER_PAGE-1) * UPROBE_XOL_SLOT_BYTES < PAGE_SIZE.
  - PAGE_SIZE on Linux base pages is at most 64 KiB in common configs (and in any case far below 2^31), so the int multiplication result is strictly less than PAGE_SIZE and cannot overflow a 32-bit int.
  - The addition to area->vaddr (unsigned long) is then performed with a small, safe offset.

Because the product is provably bounded well within 32-bit limits, there is no risk of overflow before widening, so this does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug.
