Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reported any mixed/narrow-width multiplication assigned/added to a 64-bit “size-like” LHS even when the product was provably safe in the multiplication’s own result type. In the false positive, an 8-bit register value was multiplied by 1024*1024; the product is bounded by 255*1048576 and provably fits into 32-bit, so there is no overflow before widening.
- Fix:
  - Add a lightweight, signed-aware range analysis over expressions (using 128-bit APInt) to conservatively bound operands and products.
  - Report only if there exists a multiplication on the value-producing path whose product may exceed the range of the multiplication’s own result type (i.e., could overflow before widening).
  - Walk nested multiplications and only flag the first “suspicious” one (a multiplication with potential overflow in its own type).
  - Retain existing LHS-name heuristics to stay focused on the intended bug surface (addr/size/pitch/stride).
  - Keep benign-context suppressions (e.g., IRQ/jiffies, page/folio block-size math, call args, array indices).
- Edge cases/regressions considered:
  - Nested multiplications: analyze each node; suppress if every multiplication node “fits” its own type.
  - Signed/unsigned and negative ranges handled via type-based signed ranges for comparisons; unsigned types via unsigned ranges.
  - Calls: fallback to return type ranges (e.g., u8 returns 0..255), which resolves the FP in i740fb.
  - Depth limit on recursion to avoid pathological AST forms.
- Compatibility: The checker uses only Clang-18 APIs and preserves existing includes. It uses provided utilities and doesn’t remove any include. No state traits were required for this FP; we rely on static range reasoning.
