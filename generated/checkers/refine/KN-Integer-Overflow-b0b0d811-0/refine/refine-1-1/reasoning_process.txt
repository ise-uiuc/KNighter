Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: the checker fires on kernel block/folio math like plen -= (last - i + 1) * block_size; where the multiplication is provably bounded by folio size, but our checker only uses coarse type-based maxima and name heuristics. This leads to a false positive because it cannot infer tight bounds for (last - i + 1) and block_size.
- Fix approach:
  1. Strengthen the “definitely fits” gate: keep the existing productDefinitelyFitsInType, and add a context-sensitive FP suppression for block/folio I/O math.
  2. Narrow the eligible LHS names so we focus on addr/size/pitch/stride, avoiding generic len-like locals (e.g., plen).
  3. Add a block-geometry suppression: if the multiplication is count-like × block-size-like, in an iomap/folio/page context, suppress the report.
- Edge cases: We avoid suppressing true positives by scoping the suppression to specific contexts and name patterns; the checker still reports for the DRM target cases (args->size = args->pitch * args->height and addr += (src >> 16) * cpp).
- Compatibility: The changes use Clang-18 APIs and keep all existing includes.
