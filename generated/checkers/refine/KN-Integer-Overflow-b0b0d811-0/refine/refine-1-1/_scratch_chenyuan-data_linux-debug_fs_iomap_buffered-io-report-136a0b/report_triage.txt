- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning flags plen -= (last - i + 1) * block_size; inside iomap_adjust_read_range() as a potential “narrow multiply then widen” issue. Types involved:
  - last, i, block_size are unsigned/unsigned int (32-bit on most archs).
  - plen is size_t (64-bit on 64-bit archs).
  - The product (last - i + 1) * block_size is computed in 32-bit and then used in a subtraction with a size_t.

  However, the value of the product is tightly bounded and cannot overflow 32-bit:
  - (last - i + 1) is the count of trailing blocks within the current folio range, hence ≤ blocks_per_folio = folio_size >> block_bits.
  - block_size = 1 << block_bits ≤ PAGE_SIZE (typically ≤ 64 KiB even on 64K-page archs).
  - Therefore, (last - i + 1) * block_size ≤ blocks_per_folio * block_size ≤ folio_size.
  - folio_size is limited by the maximum folio order; in practice it is far below 4 GiB (e.g., a few MiB to few tens of MiB depending on architecture), so the product always fits in 32-bit.

  Thus, there is no real risk of overflow before the widening conversion. On 32-bit architectures, size_t is 32-bit so there isn’t even a widening. On 64-bit architectures, the multiplication in 32-bit is still safe given the bounds.

  Compared to the target bug pattern (e.g., u32 × u32 assigned/added to a u64/dma_addr_t where the product can exceed 32 bits), this case does not match because:
  - The product cannot exceed 32-bit bounds due to the above constraints.
  - There is no real-world scenario where the 32-bit multiply would overflow and then get widened incorrectly.

  No corresponding fix (casting to u64 before multiply) is necessary here, and there is no pre-/post-patch evidence indicating a genuine issue.
