Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any narrow-width multiplication whose result is later assigned or added to a 64-bit type. This naively includes time/jiffies computations like a->expires_at = jiffies + (int * 10), which are not the intended target and practically safe. The checker lacks contextual filtering.
- Fix: Add a targeted false-positive filter that recognizes timeout/jiffies contexts and suppresses reports there, while preserving reports for size/address arithmetic (e.g., u64/dma_addr_t). Specifically:
  - If the RHS expression contains the identifier "jiffies", treat it as time arithmetic and suppress the warning.
  - Alternatively, if the LHS variable/field name suggests timeout-like purpose (e.g., contains "expire", "timeout", "deadline", "jiffies"), suppress.
- Maintain detection: The Mediatek buggy cases do not include "jiffies" and LHS names are like addr/size/pitch, so they still get flagged.
- Edge cases/regressions: We limit suppression to very specific time-related names to avoid hiding real issues. We keep everything else unchanged. No API changes beyond helper functions; fully compatible with Clang-18.
