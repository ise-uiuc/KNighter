Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any multiplication in a value assigned to a 64-bit (or wider) integer-like LHS. It lacks semantic filtering about what that LHS represents. This causes false positives in IRQ-domain code where the mathematics is intentionally on small bounded values (e.g., hwirq index computations), even though the LHS happens to be of type unsigned long on 64-bit platforms.
- Fixes:
  1) Restrict reporting to assignments/compound-assignments where the LHS name is address/size/byte/offset/pitch/stride-like (addr, size, len, bytes, pitch, stride, offset…). This targets the intended bug surface (u64/dma_addr_t accumulators and sizes) and avoids unrelated wide-typed counters like hwirq.
  2) Add explicit suppression for IRQ-domain-like contexts: if the function name or the LHS name looks IRQ-ish (irq, hwirq, intid, gsi, spi, ppi), treat as false positive. This specifically eliminates the reported FP in combiner_irq_domain_xlate.
  3) Improve identifier extraction to look through unary dereference so names like “*out_hwirq” still resolve to “out_hwirq”.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The filtering by semantic LHS names greatly reduces FPs but can miss rare true positives if the LHS has a non-descriptive name. However, it preserves detection of the kernel cases motivating the checker: addr += <u32*u32>, args->size = <u32*u32>, etc.
  - The IRQ-context suppression is carefully scoped to names and function patterns common to Linux IRQ-domain plumbing.
- Compatibility: Uses only Clang 18 APIs and existing includes. No includes removed. No program-state traits added (not necessary here), but the visitor/search helpers are used consistently.
