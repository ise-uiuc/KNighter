Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker ignores path-sensitive constraints, so it treats index-like variables (e.g., slot_nr) as full-width signed ints and concludes that slot_nr * SLOT_BYTES may overflow int before being added to a 64-bit address. In reality, along the taken path the analyzer knows slot_nr < UINSNS_PER_PAGE, hence slot_nr * SLOT_BYTES < PAGE_SIZE and fits safely in int.
- Fix:
  1. Incorporate path-sensitive upper bound information into the product range calculation by querying the current ProgramState constraints via inferSymbolMaxVal for the rvalue expression producing the multiplication operands.
  2. Use that bound when computing the multiplication result interval. For variables that are rvalues (from LValueToRValue casts), try to get the SymbolRef from the cast expression and bound its max.
  3. Treat common index-like names (e.g., "slot", "idx", "index", "pos") as non-negative for min-bound when querying ranges. This allows us to avoid spurious negative lower-bounds that can falsely indicate underflow in signed multiplications.
  4. Keep all existing heuristics and filters intact to preserve true positives, including the target buggy code in drivers/gpu/drm/mediatek.
- Edge cases and regressions: The new logic only suppresses a report if we can establish a path-sensitive max bound and compute that the product fits the multiplication's type. Index-like non-negativity is applied conservatively and does not mask the mediatek cases because those operands typically lack path-sensitive bounds; thus productDefinitelyFitsInType will still not be able to prove safety.
