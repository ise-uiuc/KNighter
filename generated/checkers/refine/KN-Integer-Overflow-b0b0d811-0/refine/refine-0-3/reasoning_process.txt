Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker may pick up multiplications occurring inside function call arguments (e.g., macro-expanded expressions like base + i * stride used to compute an MSR index) when the callâ€™s return value is assigned to a wide type. Such multiplications are not on the value path of the assigned/addition expression per the intended bug pattern, yet the checker reported them.
- Fix approach:
  - Introduce a robust false-positive filter that suppresses any multiplication when it is nested under a CallExpr (i.e., originates from a call argument). This ensures we only flag multiplications that directly form the value assigned/added to the wide target.
  - Keep and reuse the existing constant folding and jiffies/timeout context suppressions.
  - Add an additional filter for multiplications that are only used as array indices (non-value data path).
- Maintain detection of true positives:
  - Direct assignments: args->size = args->pitch * args->height;
  - Compound assignments: addr += (new_state->src.x1 >> 16) * fb->format->cpp[0]; etc.
  - These are not inside CallExpr arguments, so they will still be reported.
- Edge cases:
  - Still avoid traversing into call arguments in the value-path search.
  - Suppress array index usage which is not the target pattern.
- Clang-18 compatibility: No use of APIs newer than Clang 18; do not remove includes; only add a standard header and new helper functions.
