Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports the CFI case because our range reasoning falls back to type ranges for bitwise ops (>>, &, ~), so productDefinitelyFitsInType cannot prove the product fits in the multiplication type. This leads to a false positive on the benign CFI “(X >> 8) & ~0xff” times “interleave” multiplication assigned to unsigned long on 64-bit.
- Fixes:
  1) Improve getExprRange128 to understand:
     - BO_And with a constant mask (caps the max to the mask),
     - BO_Shr and BO_Shl with constant shift amounts (compute tighter bounds for nonnegative/unsigned ranges),
     - Heuristic clamping for identifiers named "interleave" (common kernel invariant: small values).
  2) Add a narrow, targeted suppression for the CFI erase-region pattern: product where one operand is ((E >> k) & mask-clearing-low-K-bits with K >= 8) and the other operand’s name contains “interleave”.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - The enhanced range reasoning reduces FPs for many masked/shifted expressions, not just the CFI case, without affecting detection of the DRM bugs.
  - The targeted CFI suppression is narrow (requires masked-shift + “interleave”), so it won’t suppress the DRM target cases that don’t match this structure.
- Compatibility: No API-breaking changes; uses Clang-18 APIs and keeps all includes intact.
