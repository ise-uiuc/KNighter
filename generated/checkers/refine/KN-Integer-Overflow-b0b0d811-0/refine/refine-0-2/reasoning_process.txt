Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fires on any multiplication whose result type is narrower than a >=64-bit target, without considering semantic bounds or domain-specific contexts. In ALSA’s snd_korg1212_capture_pointer(), the product is an index-times-frames pattern that stays within 32 bits on all realistic paths, yet it’s assigned to a 64-bit snd_pcm_uframes_t, triggering a false positive.
- Fix:
  1) Keep the core detection (target >=64 bits, product computed in narrower integer type).
  2) Add a targeted false-positive filter:
     - Recognize index × stride-like patterns used to compute PCM positions:
       - At least one multiplicand name looks like index/buffer and the other like frames/stride/period/pitch.
       - Function name contains “pointer”, and/or the LHS type is snd_pcm_uframes_t, and/or the LHS name is pos.
     - Do not suppress when the LHS looks “risky”: size/addr/dma_addr/iova/length/len/bytes/count/etc., so we still detect true positives like the Linux patch cases.
  3) Retain existing jiffies/timeout suppression.
  4) Skip constant-folded products.
- Edge cases:
  - We only suppress when the context strongly matches ALSA pointer-position computation. We explicitly avoid suppressing when the LHS name (or typedef name) indicates a size/address accumulator to keep the checker effective on the patch’s target buggy code.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs and the provided utility functions. No includes are removed.
