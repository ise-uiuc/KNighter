Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports on a benign unit-conversion multiplication dev->size = g_gb * 1024 where one operand is a small constant (1024) and the other is a module parameter representing gigabytes (g_gb). On typical 64-bit builds, the multiplication is already 64-bit; on 32-bit builds, overflow would require unrealistically large g_gb. Our checker lacks a unit-conversion heuristic and only uses type widths and coarse range reasoning, which makes it prone to flagging this pattern as a false positive.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Keep the core detection unchanged for real bugs such as u32 × u32 into u64 (args->size = args->pitch * args->height) and addr += (src_x >> 16) × cpp.
  2. Add a targeted false-positive suppressor that recognizes common memory unit scaling multiplications: when a wide LHS like size/capacity/bytes is assigned or added a product that is var × constant (one operand is a small constant like 1000 or 1024), and the non-constant operand’s name suggests a larger unit (e.g., gb/gib/gig), treat it as benign and suppress the warning.
  3. This suppression is narrow and only triggers with unit-like names and specific constants, avoiding regression on real mixed-width multiplication bugs.
- Edge cases:
  - Still reports on var × var cases, including the Mediatek patch patterns.
  - Does not suppress cases like addr += 1024 * y_offset or size64 = 4096 * count unless the variable name suggests a higher-level unit (gb/gib), so true positives remain detectable.
  - Maintains compatibility with Clang-18 API and preserves all includes.
