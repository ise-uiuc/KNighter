- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line is dev->size = g_gb * 1024;. For this to match the target bug pattern, the multiplication must be performed in a narrower type (e.g., 32-bit) and then assigned to a wider type (u64), risking overflow before widening. In null_blk, dev->size is a 64-bit quantity (u64/unsigned long long). The module parameter g_gb is defined as an unsigned long in this driver. On 64-bit kernels (the overwhelmingly common configuration for block drivers), unsigned long is 64-bit, so the expression g_gb * 1024 is evaluated in 64-bit due to the usual integer promotions. There is no pre-widen overflow, so the pattern does not apply.

Even on 32-bit kernels (where unsigned long is 32-bit), overflow would require g_gb ≥ 4,194,304 GB (≈4 PB), which is well beyond the practical or supported range for 32-bit block layers and sector_t capacities. Therefore, the multiplication either already occurs in a wide enough type (64-bit platforms) or the theoretical overflow lies outside realistic/usable ranges (32-bit). This does not align with the target bug pattern requiring a real, triggerable overflow before widening, nor is there evidence of a corresponding fix that casts to u64 here.
