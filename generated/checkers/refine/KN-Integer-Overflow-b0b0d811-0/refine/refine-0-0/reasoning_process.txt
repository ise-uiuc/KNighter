Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker traverses into CallExpr arguments (and other "opaque" contexts) while searching for multiplications. This makes it report multiplications used to compute offsets or indices (e.g., i*8 passed as a function argument), even though the multiplication's value is not the one assigned or added to the wide type. In the false positive, the multiplication was inside a call argument to read_pci_config() whereas the assignment is of the call's return value; these are unrelated for the intended bug pattern.
- Fix: Restrict the search to the value-producing path of the RHS/compound-assign RHS. Do not traverse into:
  - CallExpr arguments
  - ArraySubscriptExpr (indexes)
  - MemberExpr bases
  - Unary dereference/address-of
  - Other non-value-producing contexts
  Only traverse through nodes that propagate the value (casts, parentheses, arithmetic/comma operators in the value path, conditional operator arms, and unary arithmetic/bitwise ops).
- Keep detecting true positives: Simple multiplication into a wide type (lhs = a*b) and compound addition (lhs += a*b) will still be flagged because they remain on the value path.
- Add careful handling of comma and conditional operators to follow only the parts that contribute to the resulting value.
- Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility and do not remove any #includes.
