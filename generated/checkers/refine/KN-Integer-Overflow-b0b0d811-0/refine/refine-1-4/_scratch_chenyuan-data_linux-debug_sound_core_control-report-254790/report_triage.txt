- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warned multiplication is:
  private_size = value_sizes[info->type] * info->count;
  where value_sizes[...] is unsigned int and info->count is unsigned int, assigned to long. Although on 64-bit architectures long is wider than unsigned int and the multiplication would occur in 32-bit before being widened (matching the syntactic shape of the target pattern), the operands are tightly bounded such that 32-bit overflow cannot occur:
  - info->count is validated by snd_ctl_check_elem_info() against per-type maxima: {BOOLEAN:128, INTEGER:128, ENUMERATED:128, BYTES:512, IEC958:1, INTEGER64:64}.
  - value_sizes[] entries are compile-time sizes: sizeof(long), sizeof(long), sizeof(unsigned int), sizeof(unsigned char), sizeof(struct snd_aes_iec958), sizeof(long long). On typical ABIs these are within 1, 4, 8, or a small struct size (e.g., ~24 bytes).
  - Worst-case product: max sizeof(long) (8) × 128 = 1024 bytes; sizeof(unsigned char) (1) × 512 = 512; sizeof(long long) (8) × 64 = 512; sizeof(struct snd_aes_iec958) × 1 ≈ few tens of bytes. All are far below 2^32, so the 32-bit multiplication cannot overflow.
  Consequently, even though the multiplication is done in a narrower type, it is provably safe due to prior bounds checks, and no overflow-before-widening can occur. There is no real bug here, nor would a cast to widen before multiplication change behavior.
