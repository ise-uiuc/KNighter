Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any multiplication assigned to a 64-bit “wide” type even when the sink is a signed 64-bit long. In the ALSA case, private_size is a signed long and the product is provably bounded by earlier validation. Our checker doesn’t reason about those preconditions, and our type/sink gate was too permissive (it included signed wide types and allowed many benign “size-like” variables).
- Fixes:
  1) Narrow the sink to unsigned wide targets (>= 64 bits), which matches the intended kernel bug class (u64/dma_addr_t) and excludes signed 64-bit bookkeeping like private_size.
  2) Slightly improve constant-range reasoning by first attempting to constant-evaluate expressions, which helps avoid other constant-only FPs.
- Edge cases/regressions: Requiring unsigned wide sinks still detects the target buggy DRM code (u64 size and dma_addr_t). This change avoids noise on signed 64-bit temporaries while preserving true positives for addr/size accumulators of unsigned wide types. No Clang-18 API changes.
- No includes removed; no ABI-breaking changes. All changes are local to checker logic.
