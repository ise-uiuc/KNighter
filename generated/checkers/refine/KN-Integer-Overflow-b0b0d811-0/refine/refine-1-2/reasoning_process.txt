Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treated any multiplication whose result type is narrower than the sink type (e.g., size_t on 64-bit) as suspicious unless it could prove both operands were non-negative and had known maxima. In the reported false positive, operands came from unsigned char array indexing and small constants, but the checker ignored the small, precise ranges and required non-negativity, failing to prove safety. This led to a spurious report for a product that cannot overflow a 32-bit int.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Introduce light-weight interval analysis to compute conservative min/max bounds for expressions in 128-bit APInt domain.
  2. Enhance productDefinitelyFitsInType to use interval arithmetic over both operands, without requiring non-negativity, and check if the product range fits into the multiplication result type.
  3. Implement getExprRange128 which recognizes:
     - Integer literals, array subscript element types (e.g., unsigned char -> [0,255]),
     - Add/sub expressions, unary minus, parens/casts (with clamping to cast type),
     - Fallback to type-based ranges when info is limited.
  4. Keep existing heuristics/filters, including address/size-like LHS checks and context suppressions, to avoid regressions.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The improved range reasoning still flags real issues like u32*u32 assigned to u64 (pitch*height), because type-based ranges yield a product beyond 32-bit.
  - For cases like addr += (src_x >> 16) * cpp, where we can't derive tight ranges, the analysis falls back to type ranges and will still warn appropriately.
- Clang-18 compatibility:
  - Uses only stable Clang Static Analyzer APIs and LLVM APInt operations available in Clang 18.
  - No includes removed; only checker-internal logic enhanced.
