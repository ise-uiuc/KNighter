Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any multiplication whose result type is narrower than the wide LHS, without reasoning about whether the multiplication can actually overflow in its own computation type. In the false positive (dlen = desc->fip_dlen * FIP_BPW), both operands are non-negative and bounded (u8 × 4), and the product (<= 1020) fits into the promoted int result type, so no overflow-before-widening is possible. The checker lacks a range-aware guard.
- Fix: Add a range-aware suppression. For a multiplication BO, if the product of conservative upper bounds of both operands is guaranteed to fit in BO’s result type (considering signedness/bitwidth after usual arithmetic conversions), do not flag. We derive bounds from:
  - Integer constants and concrete SVals,
  - The constraint manager’s SymMaxVal (when available),
  - Type-based maxima (e.g., u8 => 255, s32 => 2^31-1), and non-negativity from unsignedness or positive literals.
- Keep current filters (address/size-like LHS, jiffies/IRQ contexts, mul-under-call/array-index suppression).
- Preserve detection of true positives (e.g., u32 × u32 assigned to u64). In such cases, the product’s maximum can exceed 32-bit limits; our new guard won’t suppress the report.
- Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility and do not remove any existing includes.
