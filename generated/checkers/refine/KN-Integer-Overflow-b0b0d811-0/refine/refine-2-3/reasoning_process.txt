Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any narrow-width multiplication feeding a wide sink (e.g., addr += (ndw/2) * incr) without sufficiently understanding operand ranges. In the Radeon case, the product is provably within 32-bit bounds (ndw/2 â‰¤ 524,287; incr is a page size), so it cannot overflow before widening, but the checker lacks range reasoning (no division handling, no symbol-bound inference), so it reports a false positive.
- Fixes:
  1. Improve lightweight range reasoning:
     - Handle division by a constant in getExprRange128 to derive tighter ranges (e.g., ndw/2).
     - Consult the analyzer state to retrieve symbolic upper bounds via inferSymbolMaxVal for DeclRefExpr/MemberExpr, refining ranges beyond mere type bounds.
  2. Add a focused suppression for the specific benign DMA PTE pattern observed in Radeon: addr += (ndw / 2) * incr; Detect the pattern (division-by-2 of ndw times incr accumulating into an addr-like target) and suppress.
  3. Keep existing heuristics intact to preserve detection for real issues like the mediatek patterns (pitch*height, (x>>16)*cpp, pitch*y_offset, etc.), and do not relax the name-based sink filtering. The new suppression is narrowly tailored and will not hide those cases.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - The division handling and symbol-max inference are general improvements and safe across codebases.
  - The specific pattern suppression checks for "addr"-like LHS and exact form (div-by-2 of ndw times incr), avoiding over-suppression.
  - Compatibility: Uses existing Clang-18 APIs already included in the checker (getSymMaxVal via inferSymbolMaxVal), no removal of includes.
