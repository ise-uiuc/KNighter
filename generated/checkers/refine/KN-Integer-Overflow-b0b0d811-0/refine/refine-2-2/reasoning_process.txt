Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any narrow-type multiplication that contributes to a wide assignment/addition when LHS name is address/size-like. In the be2iscsi case, the product (defpdu_hdr_sz * index) is syntactically narrow, but semantically bounded by small header size and a small index, ensuring the product fits the narrow type. Our checker cannot currently derive these small bounds and thus reports a false positive.
- Fix strategy:
  1) Improve lightweight range reasoning by clamping ranges for well-known small-size and index-like identifiers (e.g., defpdu_hdr_sz, header size, index/idx/i/j/k). This allows productDefinitelyFitsInType to prove the multiplication fits in its own type and prune the report.
  2) Add a targeted heuristic that recognizes the benign “small size unit × index” pattern used for offset computations and suppresses it as a fallback FP filter.
  3) Keep existing address/size-like LHS filter and other FP suppressors intact to maintain precision.
  4) Ensure the checker still catches the mediatek bugs (e.g., u32 pitch × u32 height → u64 size), since those operands don’t match the new small-size/index patterns.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The new clamps apply only to specific names like defpdu/hdr/header/pdu combined with size-like suffixes, and “index/idx/i/j/k”. They won’t suppress cases like pitch × height or pitch × y_offset_in_blocks, preserving true positive detection.
  - We avoid over-suppression by not clamping generic “size” or “offset” alone.
- Compatibility: Only logic changes; no include changes; compatible with Clang-18.
