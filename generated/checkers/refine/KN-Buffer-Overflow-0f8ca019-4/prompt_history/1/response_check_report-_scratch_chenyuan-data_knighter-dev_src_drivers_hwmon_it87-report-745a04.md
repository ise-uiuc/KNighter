- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line indexes IT87_REG_TEMP_OFFSET[i] inside a loop for (i = 0; i < NUM_TEMP; i++), but it is explicitly guarded by if (has_temp_offset(data) && i < NUM_TEMP_OFFSET) before the indexing. Thus, even if NUM_TEMP > NUM_TEMP_OFFSET (e.g., i could go up to 5 while the offset array size is 3), the code prevents out-of-bounds access by ensuring i < NUM_TEMP_OFFSET prior to indexing. This does not match the target bug pattern, which requires indexing without validating the index. No real bug is present, and the kind of fix described in the target pattern is already implemented here.
