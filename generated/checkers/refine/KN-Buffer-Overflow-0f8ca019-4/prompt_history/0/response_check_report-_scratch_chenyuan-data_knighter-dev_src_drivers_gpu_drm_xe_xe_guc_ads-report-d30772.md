- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code shows an off-by-one error: the loop uses "<=" with GUC_MAX_ENGINE_CLASSES, causing the index guc_class to reach GUC_MAX_ENGINE_CLASSES, while the arrays indexed by guc_class (engine_enabled_masks, ads.eng_state_size, ads.golden_context_lrca) have capacity GUC_MAX_ENGINE_CLASSES and valid indices 0..GUC_MAX_ENGINE_CLASSES-1. This is a real bug (OOB at guc_class == GUC_MAX_ENGINE_CLASSES). However, it does not match the target bug pattern, which specifically concerns mismatched macro sizes (e.g., iterating up to __DML_NUM_PLANES__ while indexing arrays sized __DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__), requiring an additional check against a different capacity macro. Here, the same macro is used for both the loop and array sizing, and the issue is solely the incorrect relational operator (<= vs <). The appropriate fix is to change the loop condition to guc_class < GUC_MAX_ENGINE_CLASSES, not to add a cross-macro bounds check as in the target pattern.
