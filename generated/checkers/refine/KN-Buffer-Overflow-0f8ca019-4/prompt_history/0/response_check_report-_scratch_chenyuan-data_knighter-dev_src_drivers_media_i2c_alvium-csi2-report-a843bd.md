- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug. In alvium_setup_mipi_fmt(), the loop iterates fmt from 0 to ALVIUM_NUM_SUPP_MIPI_DATA_FMT - 1 and indexes alvium_csi2_fmts[fmt]. In this driver, ALVIUM_NUM_SUPP_MIPI_DATA_FMT is defined to match the size of alvium_csi2_fmts (typically via ARRAY_SIZE), so this access is safe. The destination array alvium->alvium_csi2_fmt is dynamically allocated with size sz, where sz is computed in a prior loop by counting exactly the number of formats that satisfy the same conditions used in the population loop. The array is then populated using index avail_fmt_cnt, which increments only when an element is written, ensuring 0 <= avail_fmt_cnt < sz. The static analyzer’s claim that the index ‘fmt’ is used to access an array of size 5 is incorrect: the destination array is indexed by avail_fmt_cnt, not fmt, and the source alvium_csi2_fmts has capacity consistent with the loop bound. There is no mismatched macro dimension or out-of-bounds access, and no additional check like the target bug pattern’s fix is needed.
