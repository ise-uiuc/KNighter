- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug. The loop iterates i from 0 to < IPU_NUM_IRQS in steps of 32, and the array is declared as unused[IPU_NUM_IRQS / 32]. The array is indexed as unused[i / 32], so the index ranges from 0 to (IPU_NUM_IRQS - 1) / 32, which is at most (IPU_NUM_IRQS / 32) - 1 when IPU_NUM_IRQS is divisible by 32. Given the analyzerâ€™s own numbers (i goes up to 479, array size 15), IPU_NUM_IRQS is 480, making the index range 0..14, which is within bounds for a 15-element array. This is not the mismatched-macro array indexing bug described in the target pattern (no separate larger loop bound macro vs smaller array capacity macro). The code is safe and consistent with the hardware IRQ grouping by 32.
