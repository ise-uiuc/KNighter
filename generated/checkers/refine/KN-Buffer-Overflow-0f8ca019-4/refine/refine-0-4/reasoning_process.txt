Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker assumes the loop variable directly indexes the array (arr[i]) and ignores derived index expressions like arr[i / 32] or arr[i >> 5]. In the false positive, the array index is i / 32 while the array length is IPU_NUM_IRQS/32. The checker compared the loop bound (IPU_NUM_IRQS) directly to the array capacity (~15) without accounting for the divisor (32), thus reporting a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1. Recognize simple derived indices where the subscript is a linear transform of the loop variable we can reason about:
     - Direct: i
     - Division by constant: i / K
     - Right shift: i >> n (equivalent to i / (1 << n))
  2. Compute an effective index bound using ceil(UBExclusive / K) and compare that to the array capacity to decide safety. This eliminates the false positive in the IPU driver (i/32).
  3. Keep existing guards detection (if (i >= Cap) break;) so that the post-patch protected version is not flagged.
  4. Retain previous conservative suppression for i <= Cap when Div=1 to keep existing behavior and avoid potential regressions unrelated to the target bug.
  5. Be conservative for unknown complex index expressions (arr[i + k], arr[map[i]], etc.) and skip reporting to avoid new false positives.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Handle parens and implicit casts.
  - Use ceil-div to avoid overflow in Cap * Div.
  - Do not over-generalize: skip non-supported affine forms to prevent new FPs.
  - The target buggy pattern arr[i] with mismatched macros is still detected (Div=1 path).
- Clang-18 API compatibility: The change uses only AST visitors/utilities already present in the original code; no new Clang APIs are required. No includes are removed.
