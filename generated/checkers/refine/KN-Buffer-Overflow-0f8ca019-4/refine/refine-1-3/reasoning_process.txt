Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports intentional out-of-bounds accesses used by the Linux Kernel’s LKDTM self-test harness (functions named lkdtm_* in drivers/misc/lkdtm). These are not bugs in production code and should be suppressed. The current checker lacks awareness of such intentional test code, so it flags them as real issues.
- Fix approach:
  1. Add a narrow, context-aware suppression that detects LKDTM harness code by function name prefix and/or file path, and skips reporting within those functions.
  2. Keep all existing detection logic intact so the AMD DML2 mismatched macro loop (the target bug) is still detected. The patch the checker is meant to catch introduces an in-loop guard if (i >= __DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__) break; which our checker already recognizes via isGuardedByPrevIfGeBreak, so true positives remain intact.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Suppression is scoped to LKDTM: only functions with name starting with lkdtm_ or located in a path containing “/lkdtm/” will be ignored. This avoids suppressing valid issues elsewhere.
  - No changes to the macro-handling, index extraction, constant array capacity, or guarding heuristics, preserving existing true positives (including the AMD case).
- API compatibility: Uses only Clang 18-stable APIs (ASTContext, ParentMapContext, BugReporter). No removed includes; only minimal helper function additions and signature update to pass Decl context into processForStmt.
