Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: the checker’s guard recognition is too narrow. It only accepts a top-level comparison like if (i >= Cap) { break/continue; } or if (i < Cap) { use } and fails to recognize compound logical conditions, such as if ((i >= Cap) && !IS_CHAN_HT40(chan)) continue; that are common in the Linux kernel. As a result, it misreports a false positive for ath9k although the access is properly guarded by a conditional continue.
- Fix summary:
  1. Enhance guard parsing to search recursively inside logical expressions:
     - For pre-terminator guards: detect a comparator equivalent to i >= Cap even when it appears inside logical-and (&&), logical-or (||), or as a negation of i < Cap (i.e., !(i < Cap)). If such a comparator appears in the condition and the then-branch contains a break/continue/return before the array access, treat the access as safe. This precisely matches the ath9k pattern.
     - For enclosing-if LT guards: accept if the condition is a conjunction (only &&, not ||) that contains i < Cap as one conjunct guarding the then-branch where the array access occurs.
  2. Keep existing macro-based suppression and other conservative filters.
  3. Maintain the checker’s ability to detect the target AMD/DCN bug pattern, which lacks any guard.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We conservatively treat OR (||) as acceptable only for pre-terminator guards (if (cond) continue/break/return). If any disjunct is i >= Cap or !(i < Cap), then for i >= Cap the condition is guaranteed true and we will not reach the array access; thus it is safe to suppress.
  - For the enclosing-if guard (then-branch usage), we only accept AND-conjunctions that contain i < Cap; we reject any condition containing OR to avoid masking true positives.
  - We still require the terminator (break/continue/return) to occur in the then-branch of the guarding if-statement and before the use within the same block.
  - We do not remove any includes and keep compatibility with Clang-18.
