Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fails to recognize that an array access is safely guarded when the loop index bound check is part of a logical-and (&&) composite condition, e.g., if (has_temp_offset(data) && i < NUM_TEMP_OFFSET) { ... IT87_REG_TEMP_OFFSET[i] ... }. Our guard recognizers only accepted a top-level comparator (i < Cap) and did not descend into LAnd subexpressions.
- Fix: Extend guard recognition to recursively search for the index comparator inside boolean-and expressions in conditions of IfStmt and ConditionalOperator. Specifically:
  - Make parseGuardCondition recurse into BO_LAnd and combine results.
  - Make parseIVarVsConst recurse into BO_LAnd to find the comparator anywhere in the conjunction.
- Edge cases: Do not treat logical-or (||) as a valid guard because it doesnâ€™t guarantee the comparator is true in the taken branch. Keep existing heuristics for early-break/continue/return and conditional operators. Maintain macro suppression and conservative behaviors to avoid regressions.
- Compatibility: Changes are limited to AST-only utilities and remain compatible with Clang-18 APIs.
- Detection of target buggy code: Unaffected. The AMD dml2 bug still gets reported pre-patch (unguarded i indexing). Post-patch, our existing isGuardedByPrevIfGeBreak will recognize if (i >= MAX) { break; } as a guard and suppress the report.
