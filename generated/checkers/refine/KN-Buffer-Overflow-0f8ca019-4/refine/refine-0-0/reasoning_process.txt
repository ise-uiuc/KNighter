Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any array access whose index expression contains the loop variable as risky. In the false positive, the loop variable ‘fmt’ appears inside a composite index expression (alvium_csi2_fmts[fmt].fmt_av_bit) used to index a different array (is_mipi_fmt_avail). The index is not the loop variable itself, so comparing the loop bound against that array’s capacity is invalid.
- Fix: Only analyze array subscripts where the index is directly the loop variable (after ignoring parens/implicit casts). This matches the target buggy pattern (disp_cfg_to_*[i]) while avoiding the reported false positive. Additionally, strengthen the guard recognition by considering continue as a valid early-termination in the “i >= Cap” branch.
- Edge cases: This change may skip reporting in cases like arr[i + 1], but the target kernel bug is the direct i indexing case. Guard recognition enhancements reduce FPs in code using explicit bounds checks with continue.
- Clang-18 compatibility: The changes are limited to AST logic and helper functions, no API changes. Includes remain unchanged.
