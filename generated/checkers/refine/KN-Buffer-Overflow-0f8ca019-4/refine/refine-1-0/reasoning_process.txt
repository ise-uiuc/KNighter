Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker ignores local guards expressed with the conditional operator that exclude the out-of-bounds index (e.g., arr[i] only used when i != Cap), and it only considers simple enclosing-if guards (i < Cap) or previous-if-break guards. This caused a false positive in mlx5 where arr[tt] is accessed only in the false branch of (tt == MLX5_TT_ANY ? direct : indir[tt]) with MLX5_TT_ANY == array capacity.
- Fix: Teach the checker to recognize guarding via ConditionalOperator and more general comparator patterns in IfStmt. Specifically:
  - If a ConditionalOperator or IfStmt compares the loop index to the capacity and the subexpression containing the array access is in the safe branch, treat it as guarded.
  - Supported ops: <, <=, >=, >, ==, and !=. For != we also require UBExclusive <= Cap + 1.
- Keep current protections:
  - Enclosing-if guard with i < Cap remains supported.
  - Previous-if(i >= Cap) with break/continue/return remains supported.
  - Maintain division-derived index handling and macro-originated suppression as-is.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Only mark as guarded when we can match a direct comparison between the loop variable and a constant equal to the capacity.
  - For != we use an additional heuristic UBExclusive <= Cap + 1 to avoid opening false negatives in other patterns.
  - Preserve detection for the target buggy code: it has no guard; the new guard recognition does not apply there, so it will still be reported.
- API compatibility: The changes use existing Clang-18 APIs (ParentMapContext, ConditionalOperator, IfStmt, BinaryOperator).
