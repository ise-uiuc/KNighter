Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats array subscript expressions that come from macro expansions (like IF_ISSET) as plain array indexing, and uses the underlying storage array’s physical length (e.g., a bitmap word array with size 8) as the “capacity”. When the loop upper bound is the logical count (e.g., MAXMIFS = 32), this looks like UB > Cap and triggers a report, even though the macro actually performs bit arithmetic and is safe. This is a classic AST-only false positive caused by macro-expanded bitset helpers.
- Fix: Add a targeted false-positive filter for macro-originated array subscripts. If an ArraySubscriptExpr or its base/index originate in a macro expansion, skip it. This eliminates the reported false positive in ip6mr.c while preserving detection for the AMD DML2 bug pattern (which occurs in normal code, not macro expansions).
- Additional considerations:
  - Keep the checker strict in matching direct indices arr[i], which is consistent with the target buggy pattern.
  - Maintain existing guard recognition (if (i < Cap) { ... } or prior if (i >= Cap) break/return/continue) to minimize other false positives.
  - No change in includes; ensure Clang-18 compatibility by using stable APIs (SourceLocation::isMacroID, ParentMapContext).
  - Edge cases: This change may skip macro-originated true positives, but those are rare for this specific pattern and acceptable to eliminate this concrete false positive without regressing the AMD detection.
