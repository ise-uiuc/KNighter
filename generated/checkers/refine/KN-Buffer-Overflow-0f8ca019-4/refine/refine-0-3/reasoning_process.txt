Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any case where UBExclusive > array capacity, even when the loop condition is i <= CAP and the array capacity is CAP. This off-by-one pattern (<=) is a different bug type than the intended “mismatched macro sizes” target, which uses i < LARGE_MACRO while indexing arrays sized with a smaller macro. The false positive arises because the checker treats “<= CAP” with same CAP on both sides as if it were the same problem.
- Fix: Keep the core detection but suppress reports specifically for the “i <= CAP” case when the RHS equals the array’s capacity. Continue reporting when:
  - The loop uses i < RHS and RHS > capacity (classic mismatch).
  - The loop uses i <= RHS and RHS > capacity (also a mismatch).
- Implementation changes:
  - Extend getLoopIndexAndBounds to return the loop condition opcode and the evaluated RHS value.
  - In VisitArraySubscriptExpr, if the loop condition is <= and the RHS constant equals the array capacity, suppress the report.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We still detect the target buggy code in dml2_wrapper.c, which uses i < __DML_NUM_PLANES__ with arrays sized __DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__.
  - We avoid reporting the xe_guc_ads.c case (<= with same macro), which is outside the checker’s intended scope.
  - We continue to report when <= is used but RHS is strictly greater than capacity (a true mismatch).
- Compatibility: No API beyond Clang-18 is used. We retain all existing includes and patterns.
