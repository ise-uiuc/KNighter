Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports a false positive when the array indexing is effectively guarded by an early-continue/break/return conditional using a composite condition like (i >= K) && !IS_CHAN_HT40(...). The original checker:
  - Only recognized very specific guards: i < Cap in an enclosing if or a previous if (i >= Cap) with strict equality Cap-match.
  - Did not search inside composite conditions (logical-and/or) for comparisons with the loop variable.
  - Required the guard constant to equal the array capacity, which is unnecessarily strict and brittle.
- Fixes:
  - Generalize guard parsing to find any comparison involving the loop variable and a constant within arbitrary boolean expressions (LAnd/LOr).
  - Relax guard constraints:
    - Enclosing guard if (i < K) is sufficient if K <= Cap.
    - Previous-guard if (i >= K) leading to break/continue/return is sufficient if K >= Cap.
    - Also handle > and <= using normalized thresholds.
  - Recognize continue; as a valid terminator (already handled) and keep break/return.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Only suppress when we can evaluate a constant threshold K and prove K compares safely to Cap as above. This keeps detection for real mismatches.
  - Handle inverted comparisons (K < i) properly by normalizing to form i <op> K.
  - Respect composite conditions with || and && by searching for any relevant comparison subexpression.
- Maintain detection of the target buggy pattern:
  - The buggy DCN/DML loop has no such guard; thus UBExclusive > Cap will still be reported.
  - The post-patch guard if (i >= __DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__) { ... break; } will be recognized and suppressed, as intended.
- Compatibility: No API changes beyond AST-only code; compatible with Clang-18. Includes not removed.
