- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported loop in ath9k_hw_loadnf iterates i from 0 to NUM_NF_READINGS-1 (commonly 6), and indexes multiple arrays with i:
  - h[i].privNF, where h points to ah->caldata->nfCalHist, which is declared with size NUM_NF_READINGS.
  - ah->nf_regs[i], which is also defined with size NUM_NF_READINGS.
  - ath9k_hw_get_nf_limits(ah, chan)->cal[i], where cal is part of a limits structure that is defined with cal[NUM_NF_READINGS].

The code further guards non-HT40 operation by skipping indices i >= AR5416_MAX_CHAINS (3), ensuring only 0..2 are used unless the channel is HT40, in which case the extended indices 3..5 are valid and correspond to the extended-channel NF readings. The static analyzer appears to have conflated AR5416_MAX_CHAINS (3) with the capacity of cal[], which is incorrect.

This does not match the target bug pattern of indexing an array with a loop bound larger than the arrayâ€™s actual capacity due to mismatched macros, nor is there a corresponding fix that adds an extra bound check. The loop bound and array sizes are consistent, and there is no out-of-bounds access.
