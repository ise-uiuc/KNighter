Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats macro-expanded enumeration loops (like Linux kernel’s for_each_pipe) as simple numeric for-loops with linear, contiguous ranges, and compares their macro bound against the static array capacity. In reality, these macros iterate over a platform-specific subset or provide additional guarantees, and their “for” constructs are produced by macro expansion. This causes the checker to over-approximate the maximum index and emit a false positive.
- Fix: Suppress analysis for for-loops whose “for” token is from macro expansion and whose induction variable is an enum (typical for for_each_* kernel patterns, e.g., enum pipe). This is a narrowly targeted and robust heuristic that eliminates the reported FP without impacting the detection of the AMD DML bug pattern (which uses a normal for-loop with an integer index).
- Additional safety: Keep current false positive filters for macro-derived ArraySubscriptExpr nodes. Maintain the existing guards and derived-index handling.
- Edge cases: The suppression only applies when both conditions hold: macro-expanded for-loop and enumeral induction variable. This avoids skipping normal macro-generated loops that still use integer indices, minimizing regressions. The AMD target case remains unaffected.
- Compatibility: No API changes beyond standard Clang 18 SA. No removal of includes. No reliance on preprocessor macro names.
