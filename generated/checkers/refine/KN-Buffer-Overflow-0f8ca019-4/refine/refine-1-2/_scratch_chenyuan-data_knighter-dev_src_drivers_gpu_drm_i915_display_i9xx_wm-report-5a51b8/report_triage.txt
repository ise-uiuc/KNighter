- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code indexes wm->ddl[pipe] inside for_each_pipe(dev_priv, pipe). for_each_pipe iterates only over the actually present hardware pipes (num_pipes) for the given platform: VLV has 2, CHV has up to 3. The vlv_write_wm_values() function applies only to VLV/CHV, so pipe will be in [0..num_pipes-1], i.e., at most 0..2. The wm->ddl array in struct vlv_wm_values is sized to accommodate the platform’s pipes (commonly I915_MAX_PIPES, which is ≥ num_pipes). Thus no out-of-bounds access occurs. Furthermore, this does not match the target bug pattern of mismatched macro-defined loop bounds versus array capacity (like __DML_NUM_PLANES__ vs __DML2_WRAPPER_MAX_STREAMS_PLANES__). There is no need for an extra index-capacity check here, and the analyzer’s assumption that pipe “goes up to 3” on these platforms is not applicable.
