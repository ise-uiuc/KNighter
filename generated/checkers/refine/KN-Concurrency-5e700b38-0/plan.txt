Plan

1) Program state customization
- REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(SerdevOpsSet, const MemRegion*)
  - Tracks serdev devices (by pointee MemRegion) for which serdev_device_set_client_ops(...) has already been called on the current path.
- REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(SerdevReported, const MemRegion*)
  - Tracks serdev devices for which we have already emitted a report to avoid duplicate diagnostics on the same path.

Rationale:
- We only need to know if “ops are set” for a specific serdev device before it gets opened. A set keyed by the pointee MemRegion of the serdev pointer is sufficient and robust across aliases, since getMemRegionFromExpr returns the pointee’s MemRegion for pointer expressions when available.

2) Callback selection and implementation details

A. checkPostCall
Goal: Mark serdev device as having client ops set.

- Identify serdev_device_set_client_ops:
  - Get callee identifier (Call.getCalleeIdentifier()) and match name == "serdev_device_set_client_ops".
- Extract the serdev device argument:
  - The serdev argument is the 0-th parameter.
  - const Expr *SerdevArg = Call.getArgExpr(0).
  - const MemRegion *SerdevMR = getMemRegionFromExpr(SerdevArg, C).
- If SerdevMR is non-null:
  - ProgramStateRef State = C.getState();
  - State = State->add<SerdevOpsSet>(SerdevMR);
  - C.addTransition(State).

Notes:
- If getMemRegionFromExpr returns null (unmodeled value), conservatively do nothing; the checker stays silent rather than risking false positives.

B. checkPreCall
Goal: Detect devm_serdev_device_open/serdev_device_open called before ops are registered.

- Identify target open functions:
  - Match callee name in {"devm_serdev_device_open", "serdev_device_open"}.
- Extract the serdev device argument:
  - For devm_serdev_device_open(struct device *, struct serdev_device *):
    - serdev is argument index 1 (the second parameter).
  - For serdev_device_open(struct serdev_device *):
    - serdev is argument index 0.
  - Use const Expr *SerdevArg = Call.getArgExpr(Idx).
  - const MemRegion *SerdevMR = getMemRegionFromExpr(SerdevArg, C).
- If SerdevMR is null: do nothing (skip).
- Query if ops were set:
  - ProgramStateRef State = C.getState();
  - bool OpsSet = State->contains<SerdevOpsSet>(SerdevMR).
- If OpsSet is false and we have not already reported for this region:
  - If State->contains<SerdevReported>(SerdevMR) is false:
    - Generate a non-fatal error node: ExplodedNode *N = C.generateNonFatalErrorNode(State);
    - If N is null, return.
    - Create a BugType once (e.g., in checker constructor) with name "Serdev open before ops" and category "API Misuse".
    - Create and emit report:
      - auto R = std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>(BugType, "devm_serdev_device_open() called before serdev_device_set_client_ops(); callbacks may deref NULL ops", N);
      - R->addRange(SerdevArg->getSourceRange());
      - C.emitReport(std::move(R));
    - Add SerdevMR to SerdevReported set to avoid duplicates:
      - State = State->add<SerdevReported>(SerdevMR);
      - C.addTransition(State).

C. Optional: checkEndFunction
- No special cleanup required; the analyzer discards function-local state. This callback can be omitted.

3) Helper logic and notes
- Function name matching:
  - Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() and compare ID->getName() with:
    - "serdev_device_set_client_ops"
    - "devm_serdev_device_open"
    - "serdev_device_open"
- Getting the serdev MemRegion:
  - Use provided utility getMemRegionFromExpr to retrieve the pointee MemRegion of the serdev device pointer. This is robust across simple aliases because the same pointee region will be carried as the symbolic MemRegion value.
- No alias map needed:
  - Because we key on the pointee MemRegion of the serdev value (not on the variable’s own region), copies of the pointer will share the same MemRegion when modeled, so explicit alias tracking via checkBind is unnecessary here.
- Avoid heavy heuristics:
  - We do not restrict to functions named "*probe*" to keep the checker general; however, if desired, adding a mild heuristic in checkBeginFunction to record whether the analyzed function’s name contains "probe" and warn only within such functions is straightforward.

4) Reporting
- Short, clear message:
  - "devm_serdev_device_open() called before serdev_device_set_client_ops(); callbacks may deref NULL ops"
- Point to the open call (or its serdev argument range) for clarity, using addRange on the argument or the entire call expression’s source range.
