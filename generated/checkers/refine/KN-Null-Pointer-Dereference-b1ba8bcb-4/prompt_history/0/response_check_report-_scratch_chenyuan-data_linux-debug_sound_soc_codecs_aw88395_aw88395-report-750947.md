- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The optional resource is obtained via devm_gpiod_get_optional(), and while the probe code only checks IS_ERR(), the actual use site in aw88395_hw_reset() guards all dereferences with a non-NULL check: if (aw88395->reset_gpio) { gpiod_set_value_cansleep(...); }. Therefore, when the optional GPIO is absent (reset_gpio == NULL), it is not dereferenced, so the target bug pattern (NULL return from an “optional” getter followed by an unconditional dereference) does not occur here.

Note: There are other potential issues unrelated to the target pattern:
- If devm_gpiod_get_optional() returns an ERR_PTR, the code logs but continues, and aw88395_hw_reset() will treat the non-NULL ERR_PTR as valid and call gpiod_set_value_cansleep() on it.
- In the NULL case, aw88395_hw_reset()’s else branch logs using aw88395->aw_pa->dev before aw_pa is initialized, which could dereference NULL.

However, these are different from the specified target pattern (NULL deref of the optional resource), so this report does not match the target bug pattern.
