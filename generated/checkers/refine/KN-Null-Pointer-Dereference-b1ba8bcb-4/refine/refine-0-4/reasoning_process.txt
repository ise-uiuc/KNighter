Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker tracks the storage region (VarRegion/FieldRegion) where an optional pointer is stored, but when it tries to detect NULL-checks in branch conditions like if (ptr), it looks up the program state using the expressionâ€™s runtime value SVal, which resolves to the pointee region (or a symbol), not the storage region. Thus NullCheckedObserved is not set for the correct tracked region, and subsequent deref-use reports fire even when there is a guard in place. This led to the false positive at if (aw88395->reset_gpio).
- Fix: Teach the checker to recover the storage region (FieldRegion/VarRegion) from an expression syntactically, rather than using the rvalue SVal. Implement a helper that computes the storage region for lvalue-like expressions (MemberExpr, DeclRefExpr) via SValBuilder::getLValue and base regions. Use this in getTrackedRegionFromExpr so that branch-condition checks correctly update the same region that was registered in checkBind.
- Maintain true positives: The dereference detection remains unchanged; the checker still reports when only IS_ERR is checked but NULL is not, e.g., lcd->im_pins->ndescs without a preceding NULL-check.
- Edge cases: Keep existing provenance/type validation via isFalsePositive; handling for IS_ERR_OR_NULL and explicit NULL comparisons unchanged. The fix avoids regressions by tightening region matching only for condition checks; no API removals; compatible with Clang-18.
