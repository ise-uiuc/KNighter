Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker’s “fallback” tagging in checkBind marks any destination region appearing in a statement that contains an optional-getter CallExpr. During evaluation of an assignment like mcp->reset_gpio = devm_gpiod_get_optional(...), checkBind is invoked for several internal sub-binds within the same statement; the fallback consequently tags unrelated regions (e.g., the function parameter mcp) as “from optional getter.” Later, when mcp->regmap is dereferenced, the checker wrongly reports a bug because the mcp parameter was mis-tagged.
- Fixes:
  1. Remove the over-broad fallback from checkBind. Only tag storage when:
     - It is directly bound to the return symbol of a known optional-getter call (via checkPostCall + OptRetSymMap).
     - Or flags are copied from another tracked storage region explicitly via assignment (Case B).
  2. Track only “real storage” that can hold optional pointers: FieldRegion and VarRegion. Do not tag ParamRegion or other base regions. This prevents container pointers (like struct parameters) from being tagged even if any residual path would reach fallback logic.
  3. Keep dereference detection the same, but it will now only fire on true dereferences of storage known to be optional (e.g., lcd->im_pins).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Direct use of the optional getter’s return in a dereference without storing to a region (e.g., devm_gpiod_get_array_optional(...)->ndescs) is still detectable if extended to symbol-level deref detection; however, the target buggy code stores into a field first, which we still detect. The existing symbol tagging via OptRetSymMap ensures normal assignment patterns work.
  - Null-check detection remains intact (IS_ERR_OR_NULL, IS_ERR, ptr checks).
- Clang-18 compatibility: No API changes; no includes removed.
