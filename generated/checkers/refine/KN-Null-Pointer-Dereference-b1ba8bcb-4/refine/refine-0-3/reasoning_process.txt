Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker can still mark unrelated storage as “from optional getter” due to loose heuristics and lacks provenance/type validation. That allowed non-optional resources (e.g., regmap) to be treated as optional and then flagged when passed to functions like regmap_write, even though nothing was actually dereferenced and regmap getters never return NULL on success.
- Fixes:
  1) Make optional getter recognition precise by matching callee identifiers in checkPostCall instead of substring matching on source text.
  2) Track the “origin kind” of optional getters (e.g., gpiod array vs single gpiod) along with the region, and only mark pointer-typed fields/vars.
  3) At dereference report time, validate that the dereferenced pointer’s type is compatible with the origin kind (e.g., gpio_desc(s) for gpiod). Suppress diagnostics if types don’t match.
  4) Harden propagation: only propagate tags through direct binds and wipe tags on unrelated assignments; copy origin kind together with flags.
  5) Keep dereference detection strict: only trigger on true dereference contexts (->, *, []), not mere argument passing.
- Edge cases/regressions considered:
  - Still detects hx8357 pattern: lcd->im_pins comes from devm_gpiod_get_array_optional, only IS_ERR() is checked, then dereferenced via ->ndescs and desc[i] without a NULL-check.
  - Suppresses FPs such as regmap_write(pchip->regmap, ...) because: regmap is never marked from an optional getter; even if it were wrongly marked, the deref-context check and type-based guard for GPIO descriptors prevent reporting.
- Compatibility: The code stays compatible with Clang-18 APIs and retains all existing includes.
