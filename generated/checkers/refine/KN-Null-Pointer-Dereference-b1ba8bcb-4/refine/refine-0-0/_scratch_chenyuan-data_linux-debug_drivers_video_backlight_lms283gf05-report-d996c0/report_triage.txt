- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The code uses gpiod_get_optional(), which can return NULL when the reset GPIO is absent. The report flags the subsequent call to gpiod_set_consumer_name(st->reset, ...) as an unconditional dereference. However, gpiod_set_consumer_name() is designed to be NULL-safe: it returns immediately (typically 0) when passed a NULL descriptor and does not dereference it. The rest of the driver correctly guards actual GPIO operations with if (st->reset). Therefore, there is no NULL pointer dereference here, and the case does not match the target bug pattern of unconditionally dereferencing an optional resource after only checking IS_ERR().
