Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker keyed its tracking to the base region of the owning aggregate (e.g., the whole struct pointed to by “st”) and then treated any MemberExpr using “->” as a dereference of the optional resource. This caused it to (1) attribute the optional-getter provenance to the whole object, and (2) mistake benign uses like IS_ERR(st->reset) or passing st->reset to a NULL-safe function as dereferences. That led to the reported false positive.
- Fixes:
  1) Track the exact storage region that holds the optional pointer (e.g., the FieldRegion for st->reset, not the base region of st). Do not call getBaseRegion() when tracking or querying.
  2) Detect dereferences more precisely: only flag when the load of an optional pointer storage is used as the base of “->”, “*”, or “[]” (i.e., real deref contexts). This is done by inspecting the AST parents of the current load site and ensuring the load is in the base subtree of a deref-like construct. Do not treat “st->reset” itself as a deref of the optional pointer; that is merely accessing the field that holds the pointer.
  3) Keep the observation of IS_ERR/IS_ERR_OR_NULL and explicit NULL checks tied to the actual pointer storage region, not to the owning object’s base region.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Continue to report the target bug hx8357: lcd->im_pins is obtained via optional getter, only IS_ERR() is checked, then dereferenced via lcd->im_pins->ndescs or lcd->im_pins->desc[i]. Our refined deref detection reports at the true deref sites.
  - Avoid FPs when the optional pointer is used in non-deref contexts (e.g., passed to gpiod_set_consumer_name, which is NULL-safe) or when only the owning struct pointer is dereferenced (e.g., st->reset).
  - Maintain propagation on direct assignment from optional getter to a storage region; conservative alias propagation to other variables remains best-effort but the target bug pattern is unaffected.
- Compatibility: Uses only Clang-18 API and keeps all existing includes.
