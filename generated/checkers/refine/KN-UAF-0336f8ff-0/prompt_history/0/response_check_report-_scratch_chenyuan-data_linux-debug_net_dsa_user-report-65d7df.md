- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The target bug pattern is using netdev_priv (or otherwise accessing the net_deviceâ€™s private data) after calling free_netdev(), typically by canceling work that resides in the private area after the free. In the reported code path, the error branch goes to out_free where free_netdev(user_dev) is called, followed by setting port->user = NULL. This does not dereference user_dev nor its private area; it simply updates a pointer field in the external struct dsa_port to avoid a dangling reference. All accesses to netdev_priv(user_dev) (e.g., gro_cells_destroy(&p->gcells), phylink_disconnect_phy(p->dp->pl)) occur before free_netdev. There is no deferred work/timer cancellation done after free, nor any use of netdev_priv after free. Therefore, the report does not match the target bug pattern and does not represent a real bug.
