Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: the checker conflates lifetime across re-allocations and uses a loose AST containment heuristic that can accidentally associate unrelated statements with “known-deref” call arguments. This causes the dev to appear freed when it has just been allocated (e.g., via alloc_fcdev), leading to a bogus "use after free" on priv initialization lines.
- Fixes:
  1. Add epoch-based lifetime tracking for net_device objects:
     - Track per-dev allocation epoch and freed epoch.
     - On alloc_* functions (e.g., alloc_fcdev/alloc_netdev...), increment epoch and clear freed status.
     - On free_netdev, record the freed epoch. A dev is considered freed only if its FreedEpoch equals current DevEpoch.
  2. Strengthen the “statement within call argument” detection to use structural AST containment, not source range overlap, to avoid misattributing non-argument statements (like priv->pnum = pnum) to known deref calls.
  3. Keep existing behavior for mapping priv -> dev via netdev_priv and reporting when cancel_* or del_timer_* are invoked after free_netdev.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - Epoch tracking prevents false positives across reallocation and ensures new allocations are not considered freed.
  - Structural AST check avoids misfires from macro/text range overlap.
  - Maintain compatibility with Clang-18 API; no includes removed; only added helpers and ProgramState maps.
- True positive preservation: The checker still flags free_netdev(dev); cancel_work_sync(&priv->work); by recording the free and then detecting that the cancel_work_sync argument derives from priv mapped to the freed dev.
