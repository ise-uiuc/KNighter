- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line (priv->pnum = pnum) in mpt_register_lan_device() occurs before any call to free_netdev(). In this function, free_netdev(dev) is only called later, and only if register_netdev(dev) fails. Thus, there is no use of netdev_priv(dev) after free_netdev() within this path. Moreover, the remove path correctly cancels the delayed work (cancel_delayed_work_sync(&priv->post_buckets_task)) before unregister_netdev() and free_netdev(), which is the correct order per the target bug pattern. Therefore, this does not match the specified bug pattern of canceling/flushing deferred work after free_netdev(), nor is there a real use-after-free at the flagged location.
