Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker’s alias tracking in checkBind() was over-aggressive. It collapsed the LHS region to its base region (e.g., whole priv object) when binding pointer values into struct fields. This created spurious aliases between unrelated variables (like udev) and the entire netdev private region, causing checkLocation() to treat benign loads (e.g., usb_put_dev(udev)) as accesses into freed netdev private memory.
- Fixes:
  1. Stop collapsing regions to base regions in alias tracking. Record aliases using the exact lvalue regions (no getBaseRegionOrSelf for alias keys).
  2. Keep priv->dev mapping propagation across aliases, but based on exact regions only.
  3. Harden checkLocation() to report only when the accessed location is within the netdev private region: require that the actual accessed region is the same as, or a subregion of, the priv base region. This filters benign pointer loads that became “priv” only via aliasing.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The true positive pattern still triggers: netdev_priv mapping is recorded from the call, free_netdev marks the dev as freed, and a later cancel_work_sync(&priv->work) maps back to the freed dev and is reported.
  - Pointer aliases like tmp = priv continue to work because alias propagation across exact regions preserves the mapping for the alias variable.
  - We remain compatible with Clang-18 APIs and do not remove any includes.
