- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The target pattern requires using netdev’s private data (via netdev_priv(dev) or deferred work accessing it) after free_netdev(dev). In the reported path (sky2_probe error handling at err_out_free_netdev), the code checks hw->flags and calls pci_disable_msi(pdev) before free_netdev(dev). It does not access netdev_priv(dev) nor any structure embedded in the net_device’s private area after free_netdev. The struct sky2_hw *hw is allocated separately (kzalloc) and remains valid until later kfree(hw), so reading hw->flags is safe. Additionally, no deferred work/timers that could touch netdev’s private data are initialized or scheduled before this error path (restart_work and watchdog_timer are set up only after successful registrations). Therefore, this does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug.
