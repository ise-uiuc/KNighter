Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker’s generic memory load hook (checkLocation) reports any load from a region it heuristically associates with a netdev’s priv after a free_netdev(), even when the load is from a separate, shared “hw” object not inside the netdev private storage. In the sky2 false positive, hw->flags is read in an error path after free_netdev(dev1) but before free_netdev(dev); hw is shared between ports and is not a subregion of netdev priv. The generic checkLocation didn’t sufficiently constrain reports to accesses truly within the priv allocation, resulting in a spurious match.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Restrict memory-access-based reporting to only those loads that occur as part of arguments to functions known to synchronously dereference deferred work/timer (e.g., cancel_work_sync), or rely on direct call-based detection (which we already have in checkPreCall).
  2. Keep precise call-based detections:
     - Mark dev as freed at free_netdev().
     - Establish a priv->dev mapping at netdev_priv().
     - Detect uses of &priv->work in known deref functions after free.
     - Detect netdev_priv(dev) invoked after free.
  3. Add a guard in checkLocation to only proceed when the load happens inside an argument to a known-dereferencing function; otherwise, return. This avoids flagging unrelated loads like hw->flags.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We still detect the target buggy code: free_netdev(); cancel_work_sync(&priv->work); via checkPreCall.
  - We still detect netdev_priv(dev) after free_netdev(dev).
  - We avoid false positives in drivers where multiple netdevs share an external hw object and error/cleanup paths touch hw after freeing one of the netdev instances.
  - We avoid changing includes and remain compatible with Clang-18 API.
- Implementation notes:
  - Added a small AST helper to find an enclosing CallExpr for the load statement and determine if it belongs to the argument of a function that is known to dereference its argument. If not, skip reporting in checkLocation.
  - Kept program state maps Priv2DevMap and FreedDevs as before; no alias chasing beyond direct subregion checks.
