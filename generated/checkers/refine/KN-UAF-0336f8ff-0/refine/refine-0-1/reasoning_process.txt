Refinment Plan:
- Root cause: The checker uses a symmetric alias map between storage locations and pointed-to regions. This causes unrelated lvalue regions (like port->user) to be resolved to a freed net_device region through alias chasing, and then mistakenly treated as a dereference of netdev_priv. As a result, simple pointer assignments after free_netdev (e.g., port->user = NULL) are falsely reported as “Use of netdev priv after free_netdev”.
- Fixes:
  1. Remove symmetric aliasing. Do not equate an lvalue storage region with the pointed-to region. Avoid propagating priv->dev mappings through arbitrary aliases.
  2. Track the actual priv memory region returned by netdev_priv(dev) (the pointee region), and only report when a subregion of that priv region is dereferenced or passed to a known deref function.
  3. In checkLocation, ignore reads/writes of pointer-typed lvalues (reading/writing the pointer variable itself is not a dereference). Only report if the accessed location lies within a tracked priv region, and the corresponding dev is marked freed.
  4. For known-dereference functions (e.g., cancel_work_sync), look at the argument expression region and find whether it belongs to a tracked priv region, then check if the associated dev was freed.
  5. Keep reporting netdev_priv(dev) after free_netdev(dev) as before.
- Edge cases:
  - Maintain path-sensitivity with FreedDevs.
  - Avoid regressions by only matching when the region is actually within the priv region.
- API compatibility: Uses Clang-18 Static Analyzer APIs; does not remove any includes.
