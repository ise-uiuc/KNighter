- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged condition checks whether the maximum file data unit index bit-width exceeds the 32-bit limit for IV_INO_LBLK_* policies: if (fscrypt_max_file_dun_bits(...) > 32). The preceding comment states these policies “require that file data unit indices fit in 32 bits,” which means 32 is allowed and only values greater than 32 must be rejected. Therefore, using > 32 is correct; changing it to >= 32 would incorrectly reject valid 32-bit configurations. Additionally, this is not an array index validation scenario and does not match the target bug pattern (off-by-one index check for array bounds).
