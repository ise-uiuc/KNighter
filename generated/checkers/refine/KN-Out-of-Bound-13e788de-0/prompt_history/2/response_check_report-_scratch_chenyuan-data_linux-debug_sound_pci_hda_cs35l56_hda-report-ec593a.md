- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported check is not an array index validation and does not match the target bug pattern. In cs35l56_hda_posture_put, pos is a value written to a hardware register field (via regmap_update_bits_check), not an index into an array. The corresponding info function explicitly sets an inclusive range:
  - uinfo->value.integer.min = CS35L56_MAIN_POSTURE_MIN
  - uinfo->value.integer.max = CS35L56_MAIN_POSTURE_MAX
  The check uses (pos < MIN) || (pos > MAX), which correctly enforces an inclusive [MIN..MAX] range. Changing the condition to >= MAX would incorrectly reject pos == MAX and would conflict with the advertised control range, not prevent any out-of-bounds array access. There is no subsequent array access based on pos, so the off-by-one array-bound pattern does not apply.
