- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported condition checks a count (num_mws), not an index. Allowing val == MAX_MW is correct because it represents the maximum number of memory windows supported, and the array mws_size is sized to MAX_MW. Subsequent accesses do not use num_mws as an index; instead, per-window handlers parse win_no from attribute names (mw1..mw4) and index mws_size[win_no - 1], with a guard in the store path ensuring win_no <= num_mws. Thus, when num_mws == MAX_MW, valid indices are 0..MAX_MW-1 and no out-of-bounds occurs. Changing the check to >= would incorrectly reject a valid configuration (exactly MAX_MW windows). This does not match the target bug pattern (off-by-one index validation of an array index), so the warning is a false positive.
