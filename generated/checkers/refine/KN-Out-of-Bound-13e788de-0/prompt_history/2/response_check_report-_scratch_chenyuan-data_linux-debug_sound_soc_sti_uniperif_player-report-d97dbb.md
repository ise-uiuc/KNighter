- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning flags a supposedly off-by-one check using “> MAX” instead of “>= MAX,” but the code in question is not validating an array index. It validates a scalar control value (clk_adj) against an allowed inclusive range advertised via snd_sti_clk_adjustment_info: min = UNIPERIF_PLAYER_CLK_ADJ_MIN and max = UNIPERIF_PLAYER_CLK_ADJ_MAX. In ALSA control semantics, min and max are inclusive, so the correct rejection condition is (val < MIN) || (val > MAX). Using “>= MAX” would incorrectly reject the maximum value that the control declares as valid. There is no subsequent array indexing with this value, so it does not match the target bug pattern (index validation for an array of size MAX, allowing idx == MAX). Therefore, this report is a false positive relative to the specified bug pattern and not a real bug.
