- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: This is a false positive. In this code, DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX is used as the last valid generic ID, not as a count. The code consistently treats the valid range as [0..DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX], inclusive:
  - devlink_param_generic_verify() checks if (param->id > DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX) and rejects larger values, allowing param->id == DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX as valid.
  - The array devlink_param_generic is indexed by param->id, and other code iterates with for (i = 0; i <= DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX; i++), confirming the array has size DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX + 1 and that MAX is a valid index.
  - devlink_param_driver_verify() rejects ids <= DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX for driver-specific params, reinforcing that all generic IDs are in [0..MAX].
Thus, using > here is correct and does not permit an out-of-bounds access when param->id == DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX. It does not match the target bug pattern (which assumes valid indices are [0..MAX-1] and requires >=).
