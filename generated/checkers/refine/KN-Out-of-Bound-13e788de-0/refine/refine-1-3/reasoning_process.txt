Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker heuristics misclassify “min vs max” range-validity guards (e.g., if (min_asid > max_asid) …) as off-by-one index validations against a MAX-like bound. In such range guards, equality is valid (min == max is allowed), so suggesting “>=” is incorrect and results in a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1. Recognize “min-vs-max” range guards and suppress them. Implement a robust isMinMaxRangeGuard() that detects when LHS is a “min/start/lo/…” endpoint and RHS is a “max/end/hi/…” endpoint of the same base (e.g., min_asid vs max_asid). This eliminates the FP in sev.c line 159.
  2. Improve isLikelyIndexExpr() to consider RHS context and treat LHS as not index-like if it looks like a “min” endpoint checked against a “max”-like RHS.
  3. Keep other FP filters (bit-width guards, enum *_ID_MAX guards, capacity vs length checks).
  4. Ensure the original true positive in rds_recv_track_latency still fires: LHS is an index-like member expression, RHS is a MAX-like macro, and the then-branch is an error return. None of the new filters match this pattern, so it remains detected.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Avoid suppressing real issues by only filtering when both sides clearly form a min/max pair (including base-name matching after stripping tokens) or when LHS contains a min-like token and RHS is max-like.
  - This does not affect legitimate detections like idx > RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX because LHS does not look like a range endpoint.
