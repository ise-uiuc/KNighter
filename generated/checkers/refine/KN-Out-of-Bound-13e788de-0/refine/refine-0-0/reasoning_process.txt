Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any integer RHS as a “MAX-like” bound (via EvaluateExprToInt), so it warns on idioms like if (i->index > 1) that correctly check a last valid index. It also normalizes A < B to B > A and uses a loose “contains MAX” text heuristic, which can flag correct forms like x > MAX - 1.
- Fixes:
  1. Only flag comparisons written as Var > Bound (do not normalize <).
  2. Require Bound to be a plain identifier that looks like a count/size macro/constant (name contains MAX/COUNT/NUM/SIZE). Do not accept arbitrary integer literals or expressions that just fold to an integer.
  3. Explicitly exclude “MAX - 1” style bounds (which are correct). We only accept simple DeclRefExpr/MemberExpr bounds, not composite expressions.
  4. Strengthen “early return” heuristic to prefer error returns (negative constant or constant-foldable negative).
  5. Add isFalsePositive helper to gate obvious FPs (e.g., integer literal bounds).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We avoid flagging correct checks like idx > 1 (last valid index), or idx > MAX - 1.
  - We still detect the target buggy code: trace.rx_trace_pos[i] > RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX because RHS is a MAX-like identifier and the then-branch performs an error return.
  - We keep compatibility with Clang-18 API and do not remove any includes.
