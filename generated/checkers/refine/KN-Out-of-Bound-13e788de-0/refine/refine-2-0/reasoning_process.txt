Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker relies only on the presence of a “> MAX-like” comparison on the error path and a loose “index-like” heuristic for the LHS. It does not recognize symmetric “range” guards of the form (x < MIN || x > MAX) that enforce an inclusive [MIN..MAX] domain for general values (e.g., configuration/register fields), not array indices. As a result, valid inclusive range checks are reported.
- Fix:
  1. Add recognition of a paired MIN guard in the same condition for the same variable: detect a BinaryOperator (x < MIN) or (MIN > x) in the same If condition where the RHS is MIN-like and shares the same base token as the MAX-like RHS. If found, suppress the warning.
  2. Implement isPlainMinLikeBound() analogous to isPlainMaxLikeBound() and helpers to compare min/max macro “base” names via stripRangeEndpointTokens() to ensure we only suppress when the guard clearly uses a min/max pair for the same concept.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Do not suppress when the MIN bound is a plain integer literal (e.g., 0) or not MIN-like, so patterns like (idx < 0 || idx > MAX) still warn (these are true positives for off-by-one upper bound in indexing).
  - Maintain existing false-positive filters (bit-width checks, enum-id MAX, min/max-name range guard).
  - The target buggy Linux RDS pattern still triggers because it has only the “> MAX” guard (no paired MIN guard), so our new suppression does not apply.
- API compatibility: Changes use only existing Clang-18 Static Analyzer APIs and keep all includes unchanged.
