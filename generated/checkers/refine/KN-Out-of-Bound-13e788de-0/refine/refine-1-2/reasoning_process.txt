Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker assumes any guard of the form (index > MAX) inside an early-error-return if-branch is an off-by-one bug. In the false positive, param->id is not an array index but an enumeration-like identifier, and DEVLINK_PARAM_GENERIC_ID_MAX is the last valid ID (inclusive). Using > is correct here. The checker lacks discrimination between array indices and enumeration IDs where MAX denotes the last valid value.
- Fix: Introduce a targeted false-positive filter that recognizes “enum-ID-style” guards and suppresses reports for comparisons like id > ID_MAX (or *_ID_MAX). This filter keys off:
  - LHS name that looks like an enum identifier (id, type, mode, state, kind, class, family, proto, protocol, prio, level, opcode/op).
  - RHS name/text that looks like an enum max sentinel (contains ID_MAX or TOKEN_MAX where TOKEN matches the enum-ish field).
- Keep existing heuristics intact for real array index checks. The RDS buggy code uses a position index trace.rx_trace_pos[i] against RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX; LHS doesn’t look like an enum ID, so it remains a candidate and will still be reported.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Avoid over-filtering variables like idx by ensuring we only consider LHS names that equal "id" or end with/surrounded by underscores (_id, id_) or canonical enum-like tokens (type, mode, state, etc.). We specifically avoid matching substrings like "guid" or "idx".
  - Accept integer-literal RHS only when source text shows a MAX-like macro, as before.
  - Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility by only adding helper functions inside the checker and not changing registrations or includes. No changes to visitor registration or ProgramState are required for this FP.
