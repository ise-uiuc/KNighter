Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats generic “range validation” guards like (val < min || val > max) as off-by-one index validation. In the SCTP case, val is a size/length-like parameter, not an array index, and the guard is the inclusive interval check [min, max]. Our checker flagged the “> max” leg because it naively considered val a likely index and didn’t recognize the paired lower-bound guard against min.
- Fixes:
  1. Add a suppression that detects “paired lower-bound range guard” on the same LHS variable inside the same condition, e.g., val < min_len alongside val > max_len. Only suppress when the LHS is not clearly an index (not an array subscript, not strongly index-named) and not used subsequently as an array index in the same basic scope. This avoids suppressing true index bugs like idx < 0 || idx > MAX where idx is a real index.
  2. Strengthen “non-array LHS” logic to handle both DeclRefExpr and MemberExpr uniformly. We extract the referenced Decl (VarDecl/FieldDecl) and use it to check whether the value is used as an array index later. This removes a gap that could let some non-index cases slip through.
  3. Enhance exprReferencesVar() to recognize MemberExpr references, so the “used as index later” and “flows into count-like variable” heuristics work when the index-like variable is a struct/field (e.g., foo->idx).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We do not suppress when the LHS is clearly an index (names like idx, i/j/k, pos, off/offset, etc.) or when it is actually used as an array index later in the same compound statement. Hence the checker will still report bugs like if (idx < 0 || idx > MAX) return -EINVAL;.
  - The RDS target bug remains detected: the problematic comparison is on an array-subscripted LHS (trace.rx_trace_pos[i] > MAX) without a min guard for the same LHS. Our new suppression does not apply to array-subscript LHS or index-y variables, so the report still triggers for that code.
- Clang-18 compatibility: No API changes; we only add helper logic and no new includes. We keep all existing includes intact.
