- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported check is not an array index validation and does not match the target off-by-one bug pattern. In sctp_setsockopt_maxseg(), val is a length limit (maximum DATA chunk payload) validated against an inclusive range [min_len, max_len], where max_len is computed as SCTP_MAX_CHUNK_LEN - datasize. Allowing val == max_len is correct; changing the check to use >= would incorrectly reject the largest valid value. There is no subsequent array indexing with val, so no out-of-bounds risk arises. Thus, this is a false positive relative to the specified target bug pattern.
