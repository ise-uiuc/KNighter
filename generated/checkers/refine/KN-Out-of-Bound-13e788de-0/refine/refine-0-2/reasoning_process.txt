Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker was willing to flag any > comparison in an if-condition, even when the RHS was not a MAX-like bound (e.g., comparisons like x > 0 inside boolean logic). This led to a false positive in mutex.c where ww_ctx->acquired > 0 is a lock state check, not an index vs bound validation.
- Fix 1: Require the bound (RHS) to be a plain MAX-like identifier (e.g., SOME_ARRAY_MAX), not an integer literal, sizeof-expression, or composite expression (e.g., MAX-1). We already had this, but we make sure this filter is consistently applied also when parsing composite conditions with logical operators.
- Fix 2: Search within composite conditions (&&, ||) for candidate > comparisons while keeping all the filters (RHS must be a MAX-like identifier, LHS must be index-like, no buffer-capacity patterns). This allows us to detect patterns like if (idx > MAX || something_else) while still ignoring cases like ww_ctx->acquired > 0 && READ_ONCE(ww->ctx).
- Fix 3: Strengthen false-positive guards:
  - Immediately reject any comparison where RHS is an integer literal, including 0/1/2 (very common non-index guards).
  - Continue requiring the then-branch to have an early negative error return (e.g., -EFAULT), which is typical for bounds checks in kernel code.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We still detect the target buggy code in net/rds where the condition is if (trace.rx_trace_pos[i] > RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX) return -EFAULT; The RHS is a MAX-like macro, LHS is index-like, and the then branch returns a negative errno. This remains detected.
  - We avoid flagging void/bool functions returning false or non-error values.
  - We skip capacity patterns like strlen(...) + k > sizeof(buf) to avoid confusion with index validation.
- Compatibility: The updated checker maintains Clang-18 API compatibility, keeps all original includes, and uses only standard Static Analyzer APIs.
