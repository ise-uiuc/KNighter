- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged code is not an index bounds check and does not involve array access. The line checks a w/w mutex context state: if (ww_ctx->acquired > 0 && READ_ONCE(ww->ctx)) return false; This is a logical condition to disable optimistic spinning when the ww context holds any locks (> 0), not a validation of an index against a maximum. There is no MAX constant, no array sized by MAX, and no subsequent use of ww_ctx->acquired as an index. Therefore it does not match the target bug pattern (off-by-one index validation using > vs >=). Additionally, the semantics of ww_mutex make > 0 the correct threshold (zero means no locks held), so there is no off-by-one error here. No pre-/post-patch evidence indicates an off-by-one fix. This is a false positive relative to the specified bug pattern.
