Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any error-path guard of the form "val > MAX" as an off-by-one index validation, even when val is a count/config value rather than an index. In the false positive, val is written into ntb->num_mws, a count-like field. The checker’s heuristics didn’t suppress this because val has a generic name and isn’t directly an array subscript.
- Core fix:
  1) Only treat "LHS > MAX" as a candidate when LHS is clearly index-like. Strengthen the heuristic:
     - If LHS is an ArraySubscriptExpr, keep it as index-like.
     - If LHS is a DeclRefExpr, require additional evidence: either LHS is used as an array index later in the same scope (after the if), or its name is strongly index-like (idx, index, i, j, k, pos, slot, off, offset).
  2) Suppress when the validated variable flows into a "count-like" assignment later in the same scope, e.g., ntb->num_mws = val; This treats such guards as capacity/count validation, where "> MAX" is correct.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Keeps detection of the target buggy code (the rds patch) because its LHS is an ArraySubscriptExpr (trace.rx_trace_pos[i]).
  - Avoids missing true positives where the variable index is used after the guard in the same scope, or the variable name is strongly index-like.
  - Suppresses count-setting patterns like the false positive case, where the variable is written into a count-like target after the guard.
- Implementation details:
  - Add helpers to:
    - detect strong index-like names,
    - find array subscript uses of a variable after the if-statement,
    - detect count-like assignments from the variable after the if-statement.
  - Integrate these into isCandidateGtComparison by receiving the surrounding IfStmt and applying the suppressions before reporting.
- API compatibility: No Clang headers removed; only local logic changes; compatible with Clang-18.
