Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags general “>” comparisons in if conditions based on a very loose heuristic that treats any MAX/COUNT/NUM/SIZE-like RHS as a bound, without recognizing buffer-capacity checks such as “strlen(buf) + ... > sizeof(buf)”. The ALSA report is a capacity check, not an index-bound check; using “>” there is correct.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Require the LHS to look like an index-like expression (variable/member/array element), not a complex arithmetic for buffer sizing.
  2. Exclude comparisons where RHS is a sizeof(...) (UnaryExprOrTypeTraitExpr) or LHS contains strlen/strnlen; those are almost certainly buffer-capacity checks.
  3. Tighten the name heuristic for RHS bound to focus on MAX-like identifiers and avoid “size” which yields many false positives in buffer code.
  4. Keep early-error-return heuristic and other guards.
- Edge cases/regressions: The checker still reports real index off-by-one issues like the RDS case (trace.rx_trace_pos[i] > RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX). It will stop flagging “strlen(...) + ... > sizeof(...)” patterns. It may miss some exotic legitimate cases where bound name doesn’t contain MAX and LHS is arithmetic, but that’s acceptable here and does not affect the target buggy code.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Only uses stable APIs; no includes removed; no new program state traits required.
