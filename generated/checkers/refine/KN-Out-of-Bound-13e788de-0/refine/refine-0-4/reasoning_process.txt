Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any if (X > Y) guard with a name-like “MAX” RHS and an error-like return in the then branch, without sufficiently ensuring that X is an index-like expression guarding an array bound. It also doesn’t explicitly filter “bit-width” constraints like “…bits > 32”, which are not array index validations and where “> 32” is correct. This led to the false positive in fs/crypto/policy.c.
- Fixes:
  1) Tighten candidate detection:
     - Require the LHS to be index-like (DeclRefExpr/MemberExpr/ArraySubscriptExpr).
     - Require the RHS to be a simple “MAX-like” named bound (not integer literals, not sizeof, not composite).
  2) Add robust false-positive filters:
     - Do not flag “bit-width style” guards (e.g., LHS/RHS textual tokens contain “bit/bits”) or comparisons against typical bit-width literals (8, 16, 32, 64).
     - Keep rejecting integer literal RHS and “-1” adjusted forms.
     - Maintain the requirement that the then-branch be a clear error path (negative errno or error-like marker).
  3) Keep detection of the target bug:
     - The buggy code uses trace.rx_trace_pos[i] > RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX and returns -EFAULT. LHS is an ArraySubscriptExpr (index-like), RHS is a MAX-like named bound, and the then branch is an error path — it will still be reported.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - We won’t warn on boolean-return guards like return false; since the checker targets errno-style guards for array bounds. This reduces noise and avoids misclassifying non-index checks like “bits > 32”.
  - We avoid forbidding sizeof/strlen-based capacity comparisons since those are often different classes of checks.
