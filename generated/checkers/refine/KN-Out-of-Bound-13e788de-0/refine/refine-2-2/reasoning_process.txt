Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any ArraySubscriptExpr on the left-hand side of “> MAX” as an index-like entity. In ALSA’s control code, the expression ucontrol->value.integer.value[0] is a scalar control value accessed via a fixed [0] array slot, not an index used to access arrays. The checker therefore mis-classifies a parameter bound validation (with inclusive bounds) as an index bound validation and fires on “> MAX”.
- Fixes:
  1. Refine index detection:
     - If LHS is an ArraySubscriptExpr with a constant subscript (e.g., [0]), do not treat it as index-like.
     - Suppress index-likeness for known “control value array” idioms (e.g., base path contains tokens like “ucontrol”, “control”, “kcontrol”, and “value”).
  2. Paired lower-bound suppression for array-subscript LHS:
     - If the “> MAX” comparison is part of a symmetric range check “X < MIN || X > MAX” for the same LHS expression and LHS is an ArraySubscriptExpr, suppress the report. This pattern strongly indicates scalar parameter validation with inclusive bounds, not array index checking.
     - Use a structural-expression equivalence routine to match the same LHS across the disjuncts.
  3. Keep existing true positives:
     - Do not suppress DeclRefExpr/MemberExpr LHS cases (e.g., idx or j) even if there is a lower bound check, because “idx < 0 || idx > MAX” remains an off-by-one bug we want to detect.
     - Keep detection for the target buggy code: LHS is trace.rx_trace_pos[i] (ArraySubscriptExpr with non-constant index), no paired lower-bound check exists; thus it will still be reported.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Excluding ArraySubscriptExpr with constant subscript reduces false positives for scalar parameter validations that use 1-element control arrays. Legit legitimate index problems do not use constant-subscript LHS.
  - The paired lower-bound suppression is limited to ArraySubscriptExpr LHS to avoid suppressing valid index-off-by-one reports when LHS is a scalar index variable.
- Clang-18 compatibility: The changes rely only on AST utilities and the provided helper patterns, no API changes or removed includes.
