Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker considered any comparison of the form x > MAX in an early-return guard as a potential off-by-one, even when x is not an index and is never used for array indexing. In particular, DeclRefExpr LHS variables were treated as “likely index” too permissively (returning true by default), which allowed size/field validation code like ext4’s v > max to trigger. This is the source of the reported false positive.
- Key fixes:
  1. Strengthen the “index evidence” requirement. Only report when:
     - LHS is an actual ArraySubscriptExpr, or
     - The LHS variable is used as an array index in the function (either in the ‘else’ branch or later in the same function).
  2. Add detection for usage in the Else branch besides “after the if”, and a whole-function look-up to find any array indexing use of the variable anywhere in the function body. This avoids missing true positives where the array access happens in the else-branch of the very guard, or earlier/later in the function.
  3. Keep existing suppressions (enum-guard, bit-width guard, min/max paired guards, buffer capacity guards, 0/1 guards, etc.). Add slight tightening by removing the overly permissive name-only “index-like” acceptance for non-array LHS.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We still report the RDS buggy pattern: LHS is an ArraySubscriptExpr (trace.rx_trace_pos[i] > RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX), so it passes the tightened criteria.
  - Size/field validity checks like ext4’s if (v > max) are suppressed since v is not used as an array index and LHS is not an array subscript.
  - Cases where idx is validated in this function but used as an index only in other functions will no longer be reported based solely on name heuristics; this is a deliberate trade-off to reduce false positives. The checker will still report when it sees actual array-subscript evidence in this function (either directly in the guard or elsewhere in the function).
- API compatibility: The changes use only Clang-18 Stable API and do not remove any includes. All added logic is within the existing checker class. No changes to registration or exported symbols.
