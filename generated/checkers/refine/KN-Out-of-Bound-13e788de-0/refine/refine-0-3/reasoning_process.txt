Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fires on generic range/size limits like “if (buf_len > 64 * 1024)” that are not index validations against a MAX-like bound. This does not match the intended bug pattern and leads to the reported false positive.
- Fix direction:
  - Only consider comparisons where the right-hand side is clearly a MAX-like bound, preferably by name (e.g., contains “MAX”, “LIMIT”, “BOUND”). Accept macro-style bounds by inspecting the source text of the RHS.
  - Do not flag comparisons where the RHS is a pure numeric or arithmetic constant (e.g., 64*1024).
  - Filter out length-like LHS variables (len/length/size/bytes/space/cap) when the RHS is numeric/arithmetic.
  - Preserve detection of the target Linux bug: it compares against RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX and returns an error, perfectly matching the refined rules.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - Macros that expand to integer literals are accepted if the original spelled text contains MAX-like tokens.
  - We keep requiring an early error return in the then-branch to reduce noise.
  - We avoid over-restricting LHS; still allow array-subscript LHS and member expressions; only suppress clear length-limit checks.
