Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any comparison of a value against a “MAX-like” bound with ‘>’ in errno-style guards, even when it’s not an index validation. In the false positive, “period_ns > max_period_ns” is a temporal/range guard, not an array index validation.
- Fixes:
  1) Recognize and ignore “range guards” of the form (var < min || var > max) for the same LHS variable inside one condition.
  2) Heuristically filter out time/clock/rate-related guards by token inspection (e.g., “period”, “time”, “ns”, “hz”, “rate”, “clk”, etc.).
  3) Still detect true positives by:
     - Keeping the early-error-return requirement.
     - Accepting RHS bounds that are spelled as named macros like “FOO_MAX” even when the AST node is IntegerLiteral (by using the spelled source text). This is essential to catch the RDS_MAX-style Linux patterns.
  4) Maintain existing includes and Clang-18 API compatibility.

- Edge cases and regressions considered:
  - Do not warn on pure numeric literal bounds like “idx > 7”.
  - Preserve detection when the bound is a macro that expands to an IntegerLiteral but is spelled as “...MAX”.
  - Avoid FPs for bit-width checks and temporal/rate bounds.
  - Continue requiring errno-style early return in the then-branch.
