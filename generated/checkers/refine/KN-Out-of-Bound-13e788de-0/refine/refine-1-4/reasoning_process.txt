Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats comparisons against “count-like” bounds (e.g., msi_count) the same as comparisons against MAX-like array bounds. It also doesn’t recognize the common 1-based ordinal guard pattern if (!x || x > count), which is correct and not an off-by-one.
- Fixes:
  1. Tighten RHS “bound” recognition to prefer MAX/capacity-like constants and no longer treat count/num-like names as MAX bounds.
  2. Make LHS “index” recognition stricter by excluding count/ordinal-like variable names (e.g., foo_count, interrupt_num).
  3. Add a targeted suppression that recognizes “1-based ordinal” guards in the same condition: if (!x || x == 0 || x <= 0 || x < 1) || (x > Bound). This pattern is correct and should not be flagged.
- Edge cases and regressions: The changes avoid suppressing real array-index checks (e.g., a[i] > SOME_MAX) because array subscript LHS remains index-like. RHS still must be MAX/capacity-like, so detections like the RDS patch are preserved. We intentionally no longer flag idx > count (variable bound) cases to keep scope aligned with MAX-constant off-by-one pattern.
- Compatibility: The implementation uses existing Clang-18 APIs and keeps all includes intact.
