- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged check is not an off-by-one index validation issue. Here, msi_count = 1 << mme is the number of enabled MSI messages (a count), and interrupt_num is a 1-based message number. The code intentionally allows interrupt_num == msi_count, which is valid: in cdns_pcie_ep_send_msi_irq, the vector is computed as (interrupt_num - 1), and in cdns_pcie_ep_map_msi_irq the loop maps exactly interrupt_num entries via for (i = 0; i < interrupt_num; i++). There is no array indexed by interrupt_num directly, and equality does not cause out-of-bounds access. This does not match the target bug pattern (which concerns 0-based array indices checked with > instead of >=). The same check pattern appears in the send path and is correct by MSI semantics.
