Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any 32-bit multiply if there exists a 64-bit context anywhere up the ancestor chain. This incorrectly reports cases where the multiply is only used as a shift count (e.g., 0xff << ((idx - 2) * 8)) and the 64-bit widening applies to the overall shift result, not directly to the multiply result.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Only warn when the multiply result is directly used in a 64-bit context:
     - As the RHS of a 64-bit assignment (with the multiply as the full RHS, modulo parens/implicit casts).
     - Directly cast to 64-bit (C-style or immediate implicit cast).
     - Directly returned from a function returning 64-bit.
     - Directly passed as an argument to a 64-bit parameter.
  2. Suppress when the multiply is used as a shift count (RHS of << or >>), which was the reported false positive.
  3. Keep the productDefinitelyFits suppression.
- Maintain Clang-18 compatibility: Do not remove existing includes; avoid relying on new APIs. Use the provided parent-finder utilities and simple structural checks.
- Ensure the AMD bug pattern is still detected: The multiply is directly assigned to a u64 field, so it will still be reported.
