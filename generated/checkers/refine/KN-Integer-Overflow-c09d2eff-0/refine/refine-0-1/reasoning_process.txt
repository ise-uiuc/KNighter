Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only tries constant evaluation and symbolic constraints to bound operand values. For non-constant operands like struct fields, the constraint manager often has no max bound, so productDefinitelyFits() returns false, and the checker warns even when the operand’s declared type (e.g., u16) ensures the product cannot overflow 32-bit arithmetic. This caused the false positive in the reported code.
- Fix: Add a conservative, type-based fallback for getMaxForExpr(): if the exact/max value is unknown, derive an upper bound from the operand’s declared integer type before promotions (using IgnoreParenImpCasts()). Then, use that bound in productDefinitelyFits(). This suppresses the false positive while preserving true positive detection for cases like multiplying two u32s assigned to u64.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Signed vs. unsigned are handled separately when deriving type maxima.
  - The checker still warns when both operands can reach 32-bit maximums, preserving detection of the AMD bug.
  - Comparisons (e.g., count > a*b) still trigger analysis, but will be suppressed if the product provably fits in the 32-bit multiply result type.
- Compatibility: No includes removed; code uses Clang-18 APIs.
