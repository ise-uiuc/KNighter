Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker warns when seeing a 32-bit multiply whose result is used in a 64-bit context, but it fails to account for operand type bounds when symbolic constraints are absent. In sel_perm_to_ino, class is u16 and the other operand is a small compile-time constant; the product provably fits in 32 bits, so no overflow is possible.
- Fix: Enhance range reasoning in productDefinitelyFits by falling back to type-based maximums when we cannot evaluate constants or infer symbolic maximums. This will let the checker prove that products like u16 * small-constant are safe and suppress the warning.
- Additional guardrails: Slightly strengthen the contextual false-positive filter by including more non-size-like naming patterns (e.g., ino/perm/class) to avoid reporting encoding/packing arithmetic in inode and permission computations. This maintains true positive detection in size/count contexts like the AMD GPU buggy code.
- Edge cases: Preserve current logic for already 64-bit arithmetic, signed/unsigned, and do not change include directives. Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility. Ensure we still detect the target buggy pattern (u32 * u32 assigned to u64).
