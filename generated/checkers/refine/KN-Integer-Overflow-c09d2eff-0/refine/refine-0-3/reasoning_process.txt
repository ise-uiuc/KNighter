Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any 32-bit multiply subexpression that is ultimately converted to 64-bit, even when it is part of a larger expression (e.g., x * C + y). In the false positive, the multiply is used to compute a hardware IRQ number, not a size/count, and the product is bounded in practice. The checker cannot infer operand ranges there, and our current parent search accepts a distant implicit cast, so it warns.
- Fix approach:
  1) Require “direct” 64-bit use of the multiply: Only warn when the multiply is the top-level RHS of an assignment to a 64-bit integer, directly initializes a 64-bit VarDecl, is directly returned from a function returning 64-bit, or is passed as a direct argument to a 64-bit parameter. If there is any intervening non-trivial operation (like +, -, etc.) between the multiply and the 64-bit context, do not warn. This eliminates the IRQ false positive where the multiply is inside an addition.
  2) Add a lightweight semantic filter: Prefer “size-like” contexts (LHS/variable names or parameter names containing size/len/count/num/bytes/total/capacity). This keeps focus on the intended pattern and reduces FPs. Also suppress in obvious “IRQ-like” contexts (names containing irq/hwirq/interrupt/index/idx/id).
  3) Keep the existing “definitely fits” proof to suppress when the product is proven safe.
  4) Ensure compatibility with Clang-18 using ASTContext::getParents for immediate-parent checks; no API removals; no include removals.
