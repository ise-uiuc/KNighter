Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker warns on 32-bit multiplies used as 64-bit arguments (e.g., memcpy size), when in reality the operands are small compile-time constants or derived from constants (e.g., wsize = LIMB_SIZE_25519), so the product fits well within 32-bit. The checker fails to derive tight bounds for local integer variables initialized from constant expressions and thus falls back to type maxima, leading to a false positive.
- Fix strategy:
  1) Track constant-valued integer locals in ProgramState using a state map from VarDecl to APSInt. Update on DeclStmt initialization and on later assignments (checkBind). Invalidate on region changes.
  2) Enhance bound inference (getMaxForExpr) to use this state, and to fold simple constant expressions (e.g., wsize + 1), before falling back to symbolic or type-based maxima.
  3) Keep detecting the core pattern of interest: a 32-bit multiply whose result is immediately used in a 64-bit integer context (assignment to u64, var init to u64, explicit cast to 64-bit, or passing to a 64-bit parameter, or return from a function returning 64-bit).
  4) Maintain existing semantic filters to reduce noise and avoid removing includes; ensure Clang-18 API compatibility.
- Edge cases and regressions considered:
  - Multiplication used for size/count when one operand is derived from sizeof-like macros or other compile-time constants is now recognized as definitely safe and suppressed.
  - The target buggy code remains detected, since it is an assignment to a 64-bit LHS and we cannot prove the product fits in 32-bit.
  - We continue to report for functions that accept true 64-bit integer parameters (not just size_t), but the improved bound analysis should suppress spurious reports when operands are small constants.
