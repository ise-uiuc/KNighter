Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any 32-bit integer multiply whose result is immediately used in a 64-bit context (e.g., a size_t parameter), even when the product is provably small in real code. In the MSI false positive, nr_entries is a bounded value (MSI-X table entries are limited to 2048), and the other operand is the constant PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_SIZE (16), making the product safely within 32-bit. The checker failed to capture this domain constraint and therefore could not prove that the product fits.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Teach the checker a domain-specific upper bound for the well-known parameter nr_entries inside msix_map_region: nr_entries ≤ 2048. Integrate this into getMaxForExpr so productDefinitelyFits can prove safety.
  2. Add a targeted false-positive filter for the ioremap size argument in msix_map_region when the multiply is nr_entries * PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_SIZE, recognizing the well-known bounded product in this Linux PCI/MSI code path.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The new bound is limited strictly to the function msix_map_region and the parameter nr_entries, minimizing risk of suppressing real bugs.
  - The targeted suppression also requires the call to be to ioremap and one operand to be the known entry-size constant (16 or macro PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_SIZE), further reducing over-suppression.
  - The AMD GPU buggy pattern (a 32-bit multiply assigned to a 64-bit variable without promotion) remains detected since none of the newly added filters match that code, and there’s no new bound implying an always-safe product.
- API: Only uses Clang-18 available APIs; no new includes were added or removed; uses existing utility helpers.
