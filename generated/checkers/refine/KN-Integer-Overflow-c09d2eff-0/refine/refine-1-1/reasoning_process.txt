Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: productDefinitelyFits() tries to bound operands using getMaxForExpr(), but getMaxForExpr() ignores concrete values present in the current program state. For variables like try that are concretely assigned small values along the analyzed path, we fall back to type-based maxima (e.g., INT_MAX), which makes the checker think overflow is possible and report a false positive.
- Fix: Enhance getMaxForExpr() to read concrete integer values from the current ProgramState (nonloc::ConcreteInt) and use them as precise maxima. Keep existing paths for constant-folding (EvaluateExprToInt), symbolic bounds (getSymMaxVal), and type-based fallback.
- Maintain true positive detection: The AMDGPU buggy line still matches the widening-to-64-bit pattern and there are no concrete bounds on both operands; thus productDefinitelyFits() will not suppress it.
- Edge cases:
  - Signedness is preserved from the APSInt retrieved from the store or constant evaluator.
  - If exactly-known concrete values are available, suppression only occurs when the product is provably within the arithmetic width of the multiply.
  - No changes to includes or API usage; remains compatible with Clang-18.
