Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker warns on any integer multiply used in a 64-bit context, even when both operands are originally narrower-than-32-bit (e.g., 16-bit fields). This is outside the intended target bug pattern, which is two 32-bit operands multiplied using 32-bit arithmetic then widened to 64-bit.
- Fix: Gate the warning to cases where at least one operand is originally 32-bit-or-wider. Extract the original (pre-promotion) integer widths by peeling implicit casts and parens to the underlying expression type (handling bitfields). Suppress diagnostics if both operands are originally narrower than 32 bits.
- Keep existing reasoning and FP filters, and maintain tracking of constant integers. Do not remove any includes. Maintain compatibility with Clang-18.
- Ensure AMDGPU target buggy code still triggers: mall_size_per_umc (u32) * num_umc (u32) assigned to u64 will pass the new gate and still be reported.
