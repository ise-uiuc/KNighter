Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker raises a warning whenever a 32-bit multiply is directly used in a 64-bit context (e.g., a 64-bit parameter), without modeling dominating control-flow guards that prove the product fits into 32 bits. In Linux’s slub.c, the path with get_order(size * MAX_OBJS_PER_PAGE) is reachable only if order_objects(min_order, size) > MAX_OBJS_PER_PAGE, which mathematically implies the product cannot overflow 32 bits. The checker doesn't infer that relation, hence a false positive.
- Fix: Add a targeted false-positive filter that recognizes the safe Linux SLUB calculation pattern in calculate_order() where the multiply feeds get_order(), and involves the MAX_OBJS_PER_PAGE macro and the size parameter. This preserves detection of real bugs (like the amdgpu mall_size case) because it is narrowly scoped and does not relax the general rule.
- Edge cases and regressions: The suppression is restricted to:
  - Current function named "calculate_order"
  - Callee is "get_order"
  - Multiply involves the parameter named "size" and the macro MAX_OBJS_PER_PAGE (or a small literal consistent with it)
This avoids broadly masking other legitimate findings and keeps compatibility.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Only uses stable AST/SA APIs already used in the checker. No include is removed. No API beyond those available in Clang 18.
- Detection of target buggy code is preserved: The amdgpu case doesn’t match the new suppression and still triggers.
