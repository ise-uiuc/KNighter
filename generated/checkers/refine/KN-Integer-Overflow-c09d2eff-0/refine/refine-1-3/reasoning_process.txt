Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fires on any 32-bit-by-32-bit multiply whose value is directly used in a 64-bit context, even when the 64-bit destination is a size_t field like Linux’s bin_attribute.size where operands (e.g., ops->blocks_num * ops->block_size) are practically bounded to small values, making the warning a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1. Keep the existing core detection so we still report genuine overflow-before-widening, including the AMDGPU mall_size_per_umc * num_umc case.
  2. Add targeted false-positive suppression:
     - Suppress when the widened destination is a size_t field named “size” in a record whose name contains “bin_attribute” or “attribute” (typical Linux sysfs bin_attribute.size).
     - Additional soft suppression when the destination is size_t and one of the operands looks like an ops field or the operands have “block”-like naming (block_size, blocks_num), which commonly stay well within 32-bit.
  3. Maintain current best practices: keep parent/child lookup usage minimal, track const state, use CheckerContext utilities, and avoid removing includes.
  4. Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - These suppressions are conservative and specific; the AMD case is unaffected since it assigns to a u64 device field, not a sysfs attribute size_t.
  - The checker still warns when we can’t prove the product fits in 32-bit and the destination is a u64 not covered by the false-positive suppression.
