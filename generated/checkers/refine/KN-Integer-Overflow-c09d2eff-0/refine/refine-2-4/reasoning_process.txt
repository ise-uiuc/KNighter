Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports a multiply-by-widen false positive when it can’t derive realistic bounds for operands. In the LDT code, nr_entries is strictly bounded by LDT_ENTRIES, and LDT_ENTRY_SIZE is a small constant (8 or 16), so the 32-bit product is provably safe. The checker currently falls back to type maxima for unknown operands, which leads to spurious warnings.
- Fix approach:
  1. Improve bound inference: Recognize the Linux LDT idiom “...->nr_entries” (with a base containing “ldt”) and assign a conservative domain-specific upper bound (e.g., 8192). This allows productDefinitelyFits to prove fits-in-32-bit and suppress warnings.
  2. Add a precise FP filter for the common ldt pattern: suppress warnings when the multiply is between LDT_ENTRY_SIZE and the LDT entries count (either a MemberExpr “...->nr_entries” with “ldt” in the base chain or a local variable containing “nr_entries” that comes from LDT code).
  3. Keep existing logic and best practices: no includes removed; preserve true positive detection, especially the AMDGPU case (mall_size_per_umc * adev->gmc.num_umc to u64).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The domain-specific bound only triggers for MemberExpr with member “nr_entries” whose base chain mentions “ldt”; it won’t apply to other code.
  - The targeted FP filter also requires LDT_ENTRY_SIZE involvement, further scoping the suppression to LDT code.
  - AMDGPU and other genuine size/count issues still fire: the newly added logic does not match their patterns.
- Clang-18 compatibility: The changes only add helper routines and extend existing logic; APIs used are compatible.
