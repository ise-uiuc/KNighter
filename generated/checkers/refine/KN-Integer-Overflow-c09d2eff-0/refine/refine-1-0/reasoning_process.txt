Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports every 32-bit-by-32-bit multiply whose result is used in a 64-bit context, without considering common kernel allocation patterns where the multiply feeds directly (or via a size_t temporary) into an allocator like kzalloc/kmalloc. In these cases, the operands are often bounded by design and the “widen-after-overflow” warning is noise.
- Fix approach:
  1. Keep the core detection (32-bit multiply whose result is used in a 64-bit context).
  2. Add a precise contextual suppression for allocation-size uses:
     - Suppress when the multiply is passed directly as the size argument to known allocation functions (kmalloc/kzalloc/etc.).
     - Suppress when the multiply is first assigned to a size_t temporary, which is then immediately (within a few subsequent statements in the same compound statement) used as the size argument to a known allocator.
  3. Preserve existing value-range checks (productDefinitelyFits) and name heuristics.
  4. Keep detection of the AMDGPU bug (assignment to a u64 field, not an allocation call), i.e., do not suppress in such cases.
- Edge cases:
  - Direct call case: multiply directly in allocator call — suppressed.
  - Assignment then call within the same block — suppressed when used soon as size.
  - No suppression for assignment to a u64 field or return to u64 — still reported (catches AMDGPU case).
- Clang-18 compatibility: Uses existing APIs, no include changes.
