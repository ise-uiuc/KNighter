Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any implicit integer promotion to 64-bit as evidence of the problematic pattern. This includes promotions inside non-assignment arithmetic (e.g., 64-bit division), which causes false positives like the reported denominator case. The target pattern is narrower: a 32-bit multiply whose result is only promoted when materialized in a 64-bit context such as assignment/initialization to a 64-bit variable, returning from a 64-bit function, passing to a 64-bit parameter, or an explicit 64-bit cast.
- Fix: Tighten “widened use” detection to only trigger for:
  - RHS of an assignment (or initialization) to a 64-bit integer (and ensure the multiply is the immediate RHS/init expression),
  - Return expression of a function returning a 64-bit integer (ensure it’s the immediate returned expression),
  - Actual function argument to a 64-bit parameter,
  - Explicit C-style cast to 64-bit applied to the multiply.
  Avoid generic implicit cast parent detection which catches the denominator case.
- Keep the range-based suppression productDefinitelyFits for provably safe cases.
- Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility and current includes.
