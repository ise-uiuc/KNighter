- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged multiplication occurs in omap_dma_sg_size: return sg->en * sg->fn;. For TI OMAP DMA, en (element count) and fn (frame count) are hardware-limited to 16-bit values (max 65535). Thus:
  - Type/range: en, fn ≤ 65535. Their product is ≤ 65535 × 65535 = 4,294,836,225, which fits within 32 bits. No 32-bit overflow can occur in this multiply.
  - The function returns size_t. On OMAP platforms (ARM 32-bit), size_t is 32-bit; there is no “widening to 64-bit” here. Even on a hypothetical 64-bit build, the product still fits within 32-bit, so there is no pre-widening overflow to begin with.
  - The target bug pattern requires a real overflow in 32-bit arithmetic before assigning to a 64-bit type. That is not the case here: there is no overflow in the 32-bit multiply of en and fn given their constraints, and the result is not specifically assigned to a 64-bit variable.
  - While a later calculation multiplies by es_bytes (1/2/4), which could exceed 32-bit if you push absolute maxima, that is separate from the reported line and still does not match the target pattern (and OMAP hardware/driver do not support 64-bit DMA sizes or >4 GiB transfers on 32-bit systems).

Therefore, the analyzer warning does not match the specified target bug pattern and does not indicate a real bug.
