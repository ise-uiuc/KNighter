- Decision: Bug
- Reason:
  - Pattern match: In get_line_length(int xres_virtual, int bpp), the product is computed as xres_virtual * bpp where both operands are 32-bit signed ints. The result is then assigned to u_long length. On 64-bit architectures, u_long is 64-bit, so this is exactly “compute in 32-bit, then widen to 64-bit,” which matches the target bug pattern. The correct fix would be to force 64-bit arithmetic before the multiply, e.g., length = (u_long)xres_virtual * bpp; or using u64.
  - Feasibility: The 32-bit signed int multiply overflows for large but representable values, e.g., at bpp = 32, any xres_virtual >= 67,108,865 causes overflow (2,147,483,647 / 32). The vfb driver can be configured by userspace via fbdev ioctls/boot options, and get_line_length is used in both vfb_check_var and vfb_set_par to derive stride. There is no promotion in the multiply itself; thus overflow can occur before widening. Even if typical configurations don’t reach these sizes, the code path allows user-specified modes and does not enforce bounds before this computation inside get_line_length, so the overflow is real and would yield an incorrect line_length.
  - Similar fix applicability: Casting one operand to 64-bit before the multiply would perform the multiplication in 64-bit and eliminate the overflow-before-widening issue, exactly as in the target bug’s fix pattern.
