- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line computes entries_size = mm->context.ldt->nr_entries * LDT_ENTRY_SIZE where both operands are 32-bit. Although the result is stored in an unsigned long (64-bit on x86_64), no 32-bit overflow can occur due to strict bounds on nr_entries. In the LDT code, nr_entries is capped by LDT_ENTRIES (typically 8192), and LDT_ENTRY_SIZE is the size of a descriptor (8 bytes on x86_32, 16 bytes on x86_64). Thus:
  - Max product on x86_64: 8192 * 16 = 131072
  - Max product on x86_32: 8192 * 8 = 65536
  Both are far below 2^31, so the 32-bit multiply cannot overflow. Additionally, read_ldt() clamps bytecount to LDT_ENTRY_SIZE * LDT_ENTRIES before use, and nr_entries originates from alloc_ldt_struct/new_nr_entries paths that enforce the same upper bound. Therefore, this instance does not match the target bug pattern (there is no overflow before widening), and it is not a real bug.
