- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line computes the byte count for memcpy as wsize * BYTES_PER_MPI_LIMB, not a size assigned to a 64-bit variable. This does not match the target bug pattern (32-bit multiply overflow before assignment to 64-bit). Moreover:
  - Types: BYTES_PER_MPI_LIMB is sizeof(mpi_limb_t), thus of type size_t. In C, the multiplication is performed in size_t width due to usual arithmetic conversions, so there is no 32-bit intermediate overflow here.
  - Numeric bounds: LIMB_SIZE_25519 evaluates to 4 (for 64-bit limbs) or 8 (for 32-bit limbs). Therefore wsize * BYTES_PER_MPI_LIMB is at most 8*8 = 64 bytes, far below any 32-bit limit. The arrays involved are sized consistently (e.g., n has 2*wsize limbs), so the memcpy sizes are safe.
  - There is no assignment of a 32-bit product to a 64-bit variable, and the alleged overflow scenario is not feasible given the concrete bounds.

Thus the report neither matches the specified bug pattern nor indicates a real bug.
