- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code is:
  return ioremap(phys_addr, nr_entries * PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_SIZE);

  Analysis vs. target bug pattern:
  - Target pattern requires two 32-bit operands being multiplied in 32-bit arithmetic with the result then assigned to a 64-bit variable, causing overflow before the widening. Here, the result of the multiplication is passed as a function argument (size), not assigned to a 64-bit variable. This already deviates from the target bug pattern.
  - Types and bounds:
    - nr_entries is unsigned int (32-bit).
    - PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_SIZE is a small constant (16).
    - nr_entries is sourced from msix_table_size(control), which per PCI spec uses the MSI-X Table Size field (11 bits), yielding values in [1, 2048]. Thus the product is in [16, 32768], which fits safely in 32-bit without overflow.
    - ioremapâ€™s size parameter is unsigned long (size_t on many arches). Even on 64-bit, there is no 32-bit overflow here to worry about because the product fits within 32 bits; on 32-bit, it still fits comfortably.
  - Therefore, there is no realistic overflow, and the code does not exhibit the target root cause (no 32-bit overflow before widening to 64-bit). A cast to 64-bit before the multiply is unnecessary.

  Conclusion: This is a false positive relative to the specified bug pattern and not a real bug.
