- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged code multiplies a u16 class by (SEL_VEC_MAX + 1) and adds a u32 perm, returning an unsigned long:
  - sel_class_to_ino(u16 class): return (class * (SEL_VEC_MAX + 1)) | SEL_CLASS_INO_OFFSET;
  - sel_perm_to_ino(u16 class, u32 perm): return (class * (SEL_VEC_MAX + 1) + perm) | SEL_CLASS_INO_OFFSET;

  This is not the target bug pattern for two reasons:
  1) The target pattern requires 32-bit arithmetic overflowing before assignment into a 64-bit u64. Here, the expression is returned as unsigned long, not u64; on 64-bit platforms unsigned long is 64-bit, but there is no u64 variable receiving the product as per the pattern. More importantly, the arithmetic itself does not overflow 32-bit.
  2) Numeric feasibility: class is u16 (max 65535). perm comes from i+1 in a loop over nperms returned by security_get_permissions(), which is bounded by SEL_VEC_MAX (historically up to 32 for base permissions). Even if SEL_VEC_MAX were much larger (e.g., 4096), the product class * (SEL_VEC_MAX + 1) remains far below 2^31. For a signed 32-bit int, overflow would require (SEL_VEC_MAX + 1) ≥ floor(INT_MAX/65535) + 1 ≈ 32,769, which is far beyond any realistic or defined SELinux permission count. Therefore, 32-bit multiplication cannot overflow here.

  Since no overflow is actually possible and there is no pre-/post-patch evidence of a fix promoting operands to 64-bit, this warning does not match the specified bug pattern and is not a real bug.
