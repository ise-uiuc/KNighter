- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged line computes a hardware interrupt number: *out_hwirq = intspec[0] * IRQ_IN_COMBINER + intspec[1]. Here, intspec elements are u32 and IRQ_IN_COMBINER is a small constant (typically 8). The destination out_hwirq is unsigned long (32-bit on 32-bit arch, 64-bit on 64-bit arch). Although the multiply occurs in 32-bit due to operand types, the operands’ realistic ranges make 32-bit overflow infeasible: intspec[0] is a device-tree “combiner index” with practical values in the tens at most, so intspec[0] * 8 stays far below 2^32. The target bug pattern concerns size/count multiplications that overflow 32-bit before assignment to a 64-bit variable; this code is not a size calculation and does not risk overflow for any real-world input. On 32-bit architectures there isn’t even a 64-bit widening. Thus, this is a false positive relative to the specified pattern and not a real bug.
