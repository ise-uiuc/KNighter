- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line is in get_play_delay_jiffies():
  - long tmp = (size * HZ * chip->play_sample_size) / 8;
  - return tmp / (chip->play_sample_rate * chip->play_channels);
  The static analyzer warns about a 32-bit multiply that is widened after the fact, referring to the denominator product (chip->play_sample_rate * chip->play_channels). However, this does not match the target bug pattern, which specifically requires multiplying two 32-bit values and then assigning the result to a 64-bit variable (e.g., u64), causing overflow before the assignment. Here, no 64-bit (u64) assignment occurs; the result is used directly in a division, with any widening happening implicitly for the operation, not via assignment.

  Additionally, overflow of the flagged multiplication is not realistically feasible:
  - chip->play_sample_rate is a standard audio sample rate (typically ≤ 96 kHz, often ≤ 48 kHz).
  - chip->play_channels is small (1 or 2).
  - Thus, chip->play_sample_rate * chip->play_channels ≤ 192,000, far below 32-bit limits, so no 32-bit overflow occurs before any widening.
  - For the numerator, with typical bounds (size ≤ 64 KiB, HZ ≤ 1000, play_sample_size ≤ 32 bits), (size * HZ * play_sample_size) ≈ 2.097e9 at worst, which still fits within 32-bit signed range; after dividing by 8, it’s even smaller.

  Because the code does not implement the target pattern (no 32→64 assignment after overflow) and the specific 32-bit multiplication is not overflow-prone under realistic constraints, this is a false positive with respect to the target bug pattern.
