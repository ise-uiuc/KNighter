- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning is triggered at a call to find_closest(val, autorange_table, ARRAY_SIZE(autorange_table)). The alleged off-by-one pattern (loop uses i < N while accessing a[i + 1]) would only occur inside find_closest if it were incorrectly implemented. In the Linux kernel, find_closest is implemented to iterate up to size - 1 exactly to allow safe access to array[i + 1] (i.e., for (i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) ...), and returns a valid index in [0, size - 1]. Here, val is then used as an index (shifted into data->range), which matches find_closestâ€™s contract. Additionally, val was clamped to the autorange_table domain before calling find_closest, and autorange_table is monotonic as required. There is no loop in this function that matches the target bug pattern, and the helper used does not have that off-by-one issue. Therefore, this report does not match the specified bug pattern and does not represent a real bug.
