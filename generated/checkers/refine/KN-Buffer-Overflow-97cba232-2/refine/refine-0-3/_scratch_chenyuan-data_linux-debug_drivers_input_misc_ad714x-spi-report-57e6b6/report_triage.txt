- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged pattern is intentional and does not match the target off-by-one bug. In ad714x_spi_read(), the SPI transfer is set up to:
  - Transmit a 16-bit command in chip->xfer_buf[0].
  - Receive len 16-bit words into chip->xfer_buf starting at index 1: xfer[1].rx_buf = &chip->xfer_buf[1]; xfer[1].len = sizeof(u16) * len.

  After spi_sync(), the valid received words occupy chip->xfer_buf[1..len]. The loop for (i = 0; i < len; i++) data[i] = be16_to_cpu(chip->xfer_buf[i + 1]); correctly copies those len words, skipping the command word at index 0. The maximum index accessed is i + 1 = len (when i = len - 1), which is exactly the last received word.

  The loop bound “len” here is not the capacity of chip->xfer_buf; it is the number of received elements. The code assumes (and the driver allocates) chip->xfer_buf to be at least len + 1, which is standard for this SPI request-response pattern. Therefore, this is not an off-by-one array access per the target bug pattern. A genuine off-by-one fix (changing the loop to i < len - 1) would drop the last word and be incorrect.
