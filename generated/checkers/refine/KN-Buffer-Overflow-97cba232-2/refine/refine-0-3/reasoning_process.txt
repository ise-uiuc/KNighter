Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fires on benign “copy-with-offset” patterns commonly used with I/O buffers (e.g., SPI receive) where a transfer is intentionally set up to write starting at base[1], and later the loop reads base[i + 1] with bound i < len to skip the command/header word at index 0. In such cases, accessing base[i + 1] is correct and not an off-by-one error.
- Fix: Add a precise false-positive filter that detects pre-loop assignments of the form something.rx_buf = &Base[1] or something.rx_buf = Base + 1, and suppress the warning for Base[i + 1] if such an assignment occurs before the loop. Keep existing guards (local bounds, paired access a[i], loop/array-size tie) so we continue catching the real bug (e.g., the AMD dc->links[i + 1] case).
- Additional safeguards maintained:
  - Only report when loop uses i < Bound with i initialized to 0 and unit-step increment.
  - Only report when the same array base is also accessed as base[i] within the loop body (target bug pattern).
  - Only report when the loop bound equals the constant array size of the same array base (ties the loop bound to the array’s capacity).
  - Suppress when local guards ensure safety (i + 1 < X or i < X - 1 in an if-condition).
- Edge cases and regressions: The new filter only triggers when an explicit pre-loop setup assigns rx_buf to &Base[1] or Base + 1 before the loop; it does not affect the AMD case (it has no such rx_buf setup). This keeps true positives intact.
- Clang-18 compatibility: The changes use existing AST/RecursiveASTVisitor utilities and avoid non-stable APIs. No includes are removed.
