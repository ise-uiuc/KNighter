Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker can misfire in loops that use i < N but never actually access a[i + 1]. This happens due to insufficient structural correlation between “a[i]” and “a[i + 1]” array accesses within the same loop body and lack of context filtering (e.g., hardware I/O argument patterns).
- Fix approach:
  1. Strengthen detection to only report when both a[i] and a[i + 1] accesses to the same base array truly exist within the same loop body.
  2. Add robust false-positive filters:
     - Ignore subscripts that originate from macro expansions.
     - Ignore cases where the a[i + 1] subscript is used as an argument to well-known hardware I/O functions (common in NIC drivers), which frequently use simple i-based loops and may confuse source mapping.
     - Keep existing guard detection (if(i+1 < N), if(i < N-1)).
     - Require that the loop bound equals the size of the array actually indexed (preserves strong tie to the off-by-one scenario and keeps detection of the AMD bug).
  3. Preserve true positives: The AMD drm patch pattern still matches: the loop has i < MAX_PIPES*2 and accesses dc->links[i] and dc->links[i + 1] unguarded; the base is a constant-sized array; the subscript is not macro-expanded and not used in I/O calls.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - By requiring concrete a[i + 1] in the same loop body and filtering macro-origin expressions and known I/O calls, we reduce FPs in low-level drivers without losing the AMD case.
  - We continue to support MemberExpr array bases in structs, and the loop bound equivalence is kept.
  - We avoid removing any includes and keep to Clang-18 APIs.
