Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports a false positive when a loop safely protects a[i + 1] with an early-exit guard like “if (i + 1 >= N) break;” that appears textually before the array access, rather than as an ancestor guard “if (i + 1 < N) { ... a[i+1] ... }”. The current checker only looks for ancestor IfStmt guards and misses dominating early-exit guards.
- Fix:
  1. Add a dominating guard detector that scans earlier statements in the loop body for an IfStmt whose condition implies the next index would be out of bounds (patterns: i + 1 >= Bound, i == Bound - 1, i >= Bound - 1) and whose taken branch exits the loop (break/return). Ensure that the break targets the current loop.
  2. Integrate this detection into the false-positive filter.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We ensure the break actually exits the current for-loop, not an inner loop or a switch by checking the parent chain of BreakStmt.
  - We handle symmetric comparison forms (e.g., Bound <= i + 1).
  - Maintain the existing filters for local guards and SPI-like rx_buf setup.
  - Keep detection for the target buggy pattern in drm/amd code, which lacks such a guard; thus it will still be reported.
- Compatibility: The solution uses RecursiveASTVisitor, ASTContext parents, and standard Static Analyzer APIs available in Clang-18. No includes were removed.
