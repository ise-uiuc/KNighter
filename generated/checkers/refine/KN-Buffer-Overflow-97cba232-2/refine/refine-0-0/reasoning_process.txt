Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any i < Bound loop that contains a[i + 1], without understanding intended edge handling patterns. In the reported false positive, the loop starts from i = 1, handles edges before and after the loop, and accesses a different array on the i index than the one accessed with i + 1. The checker misses these nuances and flags a benign stencil/padding pattern.
- Fixes:
  1. Only report when the same array is accessed with both [i] and [i + 1] within the same loop body (the target bug pattern). This matches the Linux patch case where dc->links[i] and dc->links[i + 1] are both used.
  2. Require the induction variable to be initialized to 0 (a common idiom in simple forward loops susceptible to off-by-one when accessing [i + 1]). The FP loop initializes i to 1.
  3. Keep the existing suppression with local guards (if conditions) and (-1)-adjusted upper-bound loops.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - This reduces false positives on stencil/edge-handling loops and padded buffers.
  - It may miss some real bugs that only use [i + 1] without [i]; however, it still detects the target buggy code and keeps high precision for the specified pattern.
- API compatibility: Uses only Clang-18 public APIs and maintains existing includes. No removal of includes. No reliance on new SA traits.
