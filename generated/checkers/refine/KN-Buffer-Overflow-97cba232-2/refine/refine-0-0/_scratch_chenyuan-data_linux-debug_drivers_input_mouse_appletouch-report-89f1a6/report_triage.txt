- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The loop is correctly bounded to avoid accessing beyond the end. The effective length of the smoothing arrays is nb_sensors + 8 (indices 0..nb_sensors+7), as established by:
  - Zero-padding first 4 and last 4 entries and loading nb_sensors entries at offset +4.
  - Later summing over i < nb_sensors + 8.

In the smoothing pass:
- The loop runs for i = 1; i < nb_sensors + 7; i++, so i ranges 1..nb_sensors+6.
- The body reads dev->smooth[i + 1], whose maximum index is nb_sensors + 7, within the allocated/initialized range.
- After the loop, “other edge” handles i == nb_sensors + 7 using dev->smooth[i - 1] and dev->smooth[i], both valid.

Thus, there is no off-by-one; the code purposefully avoids iterating to the last valid index when accessing i+1. It does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug.
