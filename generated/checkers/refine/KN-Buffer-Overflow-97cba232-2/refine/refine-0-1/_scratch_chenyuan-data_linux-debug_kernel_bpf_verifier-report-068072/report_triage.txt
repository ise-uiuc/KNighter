- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged code iterates over function arguments (i from 0 to nargs-1) and accesses two different arrays: args[i] (the BTF params array of length nargs) and regs[i + 1] (the verifier’s register file). The off-by-one pattern requires accessing the same array at a[i + 1] while iterating to i < N. Here, the i+1 index is applied to regs, not args.

  Bounds feasibility:
  - nargs is checked to be ≤ MAX_BPF_FUNC_REG_ARGS before the loop.
  - regs = cur_regs(env) points to the full BPF register file (size MAX_BPF_REG, typically 11: R0..R10).
  - Inside the loop, regno = i + 1, so i + 1 ∈ [1, nargs]. With MAX_BPF_FUNC_REG_ARGS ≤ 6 in the kernel, i + 1 ≤ 6, which is well within the regs array (indices up to at least 10).
  - Therefore, regs[i + 1] is always in-bounds for all feasible nargs values.

  Since the “+1” access is on a different, larger array (regs) than the loop-bound array (args), this does not match the target off-by-one bug pattern and does not constitute a real bug.
