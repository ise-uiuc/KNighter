Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any a[i + 1] inside a loop with i < bound if it also sees a[i] on the same base in the loop body, without confirming that the “bound” actually applies to that array. In the false positive, the loop iterates over nargs (number of BTF params), but the flagged access is regs[i + 1], where regs is a pointer to a larger register file. The bound “nargs” is not the bound of “regs”, so the pattern does not constitute an off-by-one bug.
- Fix approach:
  1. Require that the array subscript base is a true constant-sized array (not just a pointer), and recover that array’s compile-time size from AST (support both DeclRefExpr and MemberExpr to ConstantArrayType).
  2. Capture the loop’s strict upper bound expression and evaluate it as an integer constant. Only report if that constant equals the array size.
  3. Retain existing requirements: loop starts at 0, unit increment, strict i < bound, not already using bound - 1, not guarded by an if check, and presence of a paired access a[i].
- This eliminates the FP (pointer base “regs”) while still detecting the AMD target bug where the base is a MemberExpr to a constant-size array (dc->links) and the loop bound equals the array size (MAX_PIPES*2).
- Edge cases considered:
  - If we cannot recover the array size (e.g., pointer, VLA, or non-constant) or cannot evaluate the bound as a constant, we skip reporting to avoid FPs.
  - The checker remains conservative and might miss some true positives with non-constant bounds, but it will still detect the target buggy code.
- Maintain Clang-18 compatibility: Use AST visitors and EvaluateAsInt; do not remove includes; only add helper functions.
