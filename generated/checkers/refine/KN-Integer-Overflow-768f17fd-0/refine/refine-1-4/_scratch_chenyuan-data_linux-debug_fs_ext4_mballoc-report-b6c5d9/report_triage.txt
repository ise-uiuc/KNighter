- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning targets a 32-bit left shift widened after the shift at dquot_free_block(inode, EXT4_C2B(sbi, count_clusters)). In ext4, EXT4_C2B is defined to operate in block-number width (ext4_fsblk_t, 64-bit) by casting before the shift, so the shift is performed in 64-bit. Even if one assumed no cast in the macro, this particular call site cannot overflow 32-bit: earlier logic ensures the free extent is confined within a single block group and aligned to full clusters (see the adjustments around lines 6591â€“6625 and the group-boundary check at 6428). Consequently, count_clusters = count >> s_cluster_bits with count <= EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb). Since EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb) is bounded by the bitmap size (typically 8 * blocksize, i.e., up to 524,288 blocks for 64k block size), EXT4_C2B(sbi, count_clusters) equals count and remains <= 524,288, well within 32-bit. Therefore, no 32-bit truncation can occur here, and the report does not match the target bug pattern nor a real bug.
