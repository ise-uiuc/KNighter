Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports shifts in 32-bit that are later widened even when they are intentional, bounded “unit-scaling” shifts (e.g., EXT4_C2B: clusters -> blocks) that are safe due to prior range checks or because the shift operand and amount are domain-specific (e.g., “clusters” << “cluster_bits”). The current checker lacks contextual suppression for such patterns and cannot prove safety from constraints in these cases.
- Fix approach:
  1. Retain the core detection logic for true positives (like the i915 tau4 bug).
  2. Add a targeted false-positive filter for “unit-scaling” shifts commonly seen in Linux FS code:
     - Suppress when the shift expression is the whole call argument and it’s a likely unit-scaling pattern:
       - Whole argument source contains EXT4_C2B (macro-based scaling).
       - Or RHS mentions cluster_bits, and LHS mentions cluster/clusters, and LHS is a simple variable/member (not a composite like (1<<x)|y).
     - Keep existing small-shift and IO/register heuristics.
  3. Keep the existing constant/upper-bound safety proofs; add the new suppression only in argument context to minimize regressions.
  4. Maintain API compatibility with Clang-18 and do not remove any includes.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The new suppression is applied only for call-argument contexts and for clear cluster-scaling patterns, so detection for the i915 patch (variable initialization/assignment to u64) remains intact.
  - We ensure not to suppress when the left operand is a composite expression (e.g., with '|', '+', etc.), which is typical of the actual bug pattern.
  - We also prefer macro-name based suppression (EXT4_C2B) to be robust even if names change slightly in either operand.
