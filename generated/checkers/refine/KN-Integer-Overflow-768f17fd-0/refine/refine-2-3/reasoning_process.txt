Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats all 32-bit shifts that are widened afterward as potentially problematic, without recognizing bounded-width bitfields. In the false positive, the left operand is a small unsigned bitfield and the shift amount is a small constant, making the 32-bit shift provably safe.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Teach the checker to understand C bitfields: compute an upper bound for a MemberExpr that refers to a bitfield by using its declared bit width and signedness.
  2. Add a targeted false-positive filter: if the left operand is an unsigned bitfield with width W and the right shift operand is a constant K such that W + K <= operation width (typically 32), suppress the warning.
  3. Integrate bitfield bounds into the existing upper-bound framework (computeExprUpperBoundEx and computeExprMaxActiveBits), so the checker can reason about the safety of shifts more often, reducing other potential FPs.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Only suppress when the bitfield is unsigned; for signed bitfields left-shifting negative values is undefined, so we do not suppress.
  - Clamp computations correctly and use conservative upper bounds for signed bitfields (2^(W-1)-1).
  - These changes do not affect the detection of the target buggy pattern in i915, which does not involve a bitfield as the left operand.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Uses FieldDecl::isBitField() and FieldDecl::getBitWidthValue(ASTContext), which are available in Clang 18. No includes removed.
