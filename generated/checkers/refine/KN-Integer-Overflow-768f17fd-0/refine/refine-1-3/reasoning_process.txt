Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports whenever a 32-bit left-shift feeds into a 64-bit destination, without considering whether the shift result provably fits in 32 bits. In the false positive, the shift amount (PAGE_SHIFT + order) is bounded (order â‰¤ MAX_PAGE_ORDER), ensuring 1 << (PAGE_SHIFT + order) fits in 32 bits on real configs, but the checker lacks range reasoning to prove it, so it warns.
- Fix: Add path-sensitive upper-bound reasoning for shift operands using a program-state map. Track per-variable upper bounds when assigned from expressions containing known constants (e.g., min(..., C) patterns), then suppress if we can prove the left-shift result fits in the LHS bitwidth using these upper bounds. Keep existing checks and heuristics.
- Maintain detection of real bugs: The i915 tau4 case still warns because the checker cannot prove the result fits into 32 bits; the state-derived bounds for x and y are not tight enough (and likely large), so no suppression occurs.
- Edge cases: Only suppress when we can prove safety under computed upper bounds. Otherwise we keep warning. We keep existing constant folding checks and call-argument heuristics. This avoids regressions and keeps Clang-18 compatibility.
