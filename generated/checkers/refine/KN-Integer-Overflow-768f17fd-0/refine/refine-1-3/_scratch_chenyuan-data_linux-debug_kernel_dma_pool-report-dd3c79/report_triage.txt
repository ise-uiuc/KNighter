- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line computes pool_size = 1 << (PAGE_SHIFT + order). The left operand is an int literal, so the shift is performed in 32-bit. However:
  - order is bounded: order = min(get_order(pool_size), MAX_PAGE_ORDER). In practice MAX_PAGE_ORDER is small (derived from MAX_ORDER, typically around 10â€“11 across architectures).
  - PAGE_SHIFT is at most 16 (64K pages).
  - Therefore PAGE_SHIFT + order is well below 31 on real configurations, yielding a value that fits within 32-bit int (e.g., with PAGE_SHIFT=16 and order=10, the result is 1<<26 = 64 MiB).
  - The assignment to size_t (64-bit on 64-bit platforms) does not lose bits; the computed value remains within 32-bit range.
  - This does not match the target bug pattern (a 32-bit shift whose intended result exceeds 32 bits and is only widened after the shift, causing truncation). There is no evidence of overflow/truncation here, and no corresponding kernel fix that casts before the shift.

Given the bounded ranges, the shift result never requires more than 32 bits, so the warning is a false positive relative to the target pattern and not a real bug.
