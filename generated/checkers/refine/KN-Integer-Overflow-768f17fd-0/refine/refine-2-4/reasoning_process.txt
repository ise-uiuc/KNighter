Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker assumes the LHS of the shift can take the full range of its type when it cannot derive tighter upper bounds. For expressions like entries << PAGE_SHIFT used to convert page counts to bytes, this leads to a false positive in legacy hardware code where counts are inherently bounded but not modeled by the analyzer.
- Fix: Introduce a focused false-positive filter that:
  - Recognizes the common “page-count to bytes” pattern: shift by PAGE_SHIFT and LHS name indicating a count of pages/entries.
  - Suppresses the warning only in this specific scenario, and only when the LHS upper bound is not derived from local expression analysis (i.e., we have no better information than generic symbolic/type constraints).
- Preserve true positives: The i915 hwmon bug (tau4 = ((1 << x_w) | x) << y) continues to be reported:
  - RHS is not PAGE_SHIFT.
  - LHS does not look like a page count/entries.
  - Our upper-bound computation can derive precise bounds from the masking and shifting macros, so the checker still proves possible overflow in 32-bit and reports it.
