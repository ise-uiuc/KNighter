- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged line uses a per-port mask macro inside a 32-bit register manipulation:
  - value is unsigned long but holds a u32 read from AFI_PCIE_CONFIG, and is later written back via afi_writel (u32). Only the low 32 bits are meaningful.
  - AFI_PCIE_CONFIG_PCIE_DISABLE(port->index) is a bitmask macro that shifts by a small amount (the analyzer itself assumes the shift count is less than 32). Even if the macro’s left operand were a 32-bit literal (e.g., 1U), shifting by <32 does not overflow 32 bits.
  - There is no assignment to u64 nor any further shift; the expression is just used as a 32-bit mask in a bitwise AND with value. On 64-bit builds, integer promotions will zero-extend the 32-bit mask to unsigned long; no bits are lost or miscomputed because the register width is 32 bits and value’s upper 32 bits are zero.
  - The target bug pattern requires a 32-bit shift whose result should extend beyond 32 bits and only widens to 64-bit after the shift, causing truncation. That is not the case here: the shift remains within 32-bit range and the operation domain is a 32-bit hardware register.
  - There is no corresponding fix patch changing this to a u64 cast, and such a cast would be unnecessary for a 32-bit register write.

Therefore, this report does not match the specified bug pattern and does not represent a real bug.
