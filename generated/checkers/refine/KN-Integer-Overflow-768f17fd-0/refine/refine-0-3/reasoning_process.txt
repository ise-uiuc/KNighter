Refinement Plan:
- Root cause of false positive:
  - The checker was reporting shifts nested inside compound/bitwise operations assigned to a 64-bit-typed LHS, even though the shift result is only used as a 32-bit mask for a 32-bit hardware register value (e.g., value &= ~BIT(i)). In particular, when the LHS variable is a 64-bit unsigned long used to hold a u32 register value (readl), mask-building shifts should not be flagged.
  - Additionally, for compound assignment operators (like &=), checkBind passed only the RHS subtree to the analyzer. Without tracking the destination variable’s “effective width” and intent, nested shifts for mask building could be misinterpreted as 32->64 wideners.

- Fixes to checker logic:
  1. Add top-level-expression suppression (already present) so we only report when the shift is the top-level expression being assigned/returned/passed. This avoids most bitmask/compound expression FPs.
  2. Track variables that effectively carry 32-bit hardware register semantics even if their C type is 64-bit:
     - Register a ProgramState set to store MemRegion of variables assigned from 32-bit sources (e.g., readl() returning u32).
     - On simple assignment/initialization, if a 64-bit variable receives a ≤32-bit value from a likely register-read expression (call/var/field of ≤32-bit type; not an integer literal), mark it as Reg32.
     - If it later receives a ≥64-bit value, unmark it.
     - When analyzing potential reports for assignments to such variables, suppress warnings (since only lower 32 bits are meaningful).
  3. Add another safe-suppression: if both operands are constant and the result provably fits into the original LHS width (existing constant suppression), keep it.
  4. Maintain detection of true positives (e.g., tau4 = ((1 << x_w) | x) << y assigned to u64) by:
     - Requiring the shift to be top-level.
     - Not marking such variables as Reg32 (they are not assigned from 32-bit hardware reads).
     - Respecting explicit casts to widen to 64-bit before shift, as a fix.

- Edge cases and regressions considered:
  - Avoid marking general u64 variables as Reg32 just because of zero-initialization; only mark on non-literal ≤32-bit sources (e.g., readl() or other ≤32-bit-typed expressions).
  - Unmark Reg32 when a ≥64-bit value is assigned.
  - Do not suppress when the shift is top-level feeding a 64-bit destination (our target bug), nor when we cannot prove safety.

- Clang-18 API compatibility:
  - Use REGISTER_SET_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE to track Reg32 variables.
  - Use CheckerContext, ProgramStateRef, CallEvent, and SVal APIs available in Clang-18.
  - Do not remove any existing includes.
