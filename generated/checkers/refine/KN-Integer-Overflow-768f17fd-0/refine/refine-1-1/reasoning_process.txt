Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags any 32-bit shift whose result is assigned to a 64-bit destination, even when it is provably safe because the shifted value still fits in 32 bits. In the ext4 false positive, the left operand is a constant 1 and the shift count is provably bounded so the result fits within 32 bits.
- Fix: Suppress reports when the analyzer can prove (using constants or path-sensitive upper bounds) that the shifted result definitely fits in the shift’s computation type width (typically 32-bit int or unsigned int). We add:
  - A constant-based safety check using actual shift type width and signedness.
  - A path-sensitive safety check using the current ProgramState to obtain a maximum bound for the shift amount (via getSVal/inferSymbolMaxVal) and a constant left operand’s active bits.
- Keep reporting for the target i915 buggy code because the left operand is not constant, and we cannot bound it precisely; thus suppression will not trigger there.
- Edge cases: Handle signed vs unsigned shift types; handle constant left operand equal to 0; handle situations where we cannot infer useful bounds (in which case we do not suppress).
- Maintain Clang-18 compatibility and do not remove any includes.
