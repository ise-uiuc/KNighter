Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: the checker lacks reasoning about dominating loop bounds and path constraints that ensure the shift amount stays below the 32-bit width, leading to a false positive on patterns like size = 1 << start_order; where start_order is bounded by a for-loop condition (start_order < NR_PAGE_ORDERS). The analyzer failed to prove that the shift result fits into 32 bits before widening.
- Fix: augment the suppression logic to infer an upper bound on the shift amount from dominating loop/while conditions in the AST (without relying on solver constraints). If we can prove that MaxActiveBits(LHS) + MaxShiftAmt <= LHS bit-width (e.g. 32), suppress the warning. This directly addresses the Linux FP while preserving detection of the actual bug pattern (the i915 tau4 computation).
- Implementation details:
  - Add AST-based extraction of variable upper bounds from surrounding ForStmt/WhileStmt conditions for the RHS shift amount variable (patterns like var < K, var <= K, K > var, K >= var), including conjunctions with &&.
  - Integrate this bound inference into shiftSafeUnderUpperBounds as a fallback when general upper bounds cannot be computed by the constraint manager.
  - Keep existing detection unchanged to ensure the i915 bug is still detected (we do not suppress when LHS is not trivially small or when the bound could exceed 32).
- Edge cases and regressions considered:
  - Only suppress when we can prove safety: MaxActiveBits(L) + MaxShiftAmt <= LHSW (where LHSW is the width of the left shift operand type, typically 32). If the inferred bound is â‰¥ 32, we do not suppress (we still report).
  - This does not suppress the i915 case: there, LHS is ((1 << x_w) | x) and cannot be proven small, and the RHS y bound is not inferred via a dominating loop condition; thus the checker continues to report.
  - Handles conditions even if constants are macro-expanded (EvaluateExprToInt is used).
  - Maintains Clang-18 API compatibility and does not remove any includes.
