- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning flags size = 1 << start_order; as a 32-bit shift widened after the fact. Here, size is unsigned long (64-bit on 64-bit arch, 32-bit on 32-bit arch), but the shift operand 1 is a 32-bit int, so the shift is indeed performed in 32-bit. However, start_order is tightly bounded: it is less than NR_PAGE_ORDERS and corresponds to a buddy allocator order with a non-empty freelist. In practice and by design, MAX_ORDER (and hence NR_PAGE_ORDERS) is small (default 11; even when configured larger, non-empty orders ≥ 32 would require contiguous blocks of size 2^32 pages, i.e., ≥ 16 TiB for 4K pages, which cannot exist as a buddy block). Therefore, start_order < 32 always when this line executes, so 1 << start_order fits within 32 bits with no overflow/truncation. Also, this code does not involve a u64 target or intent requiring a 64-bit shift; on 32-bit kernels unsigned long is 32-bit anyway. Casting to 64-bit before the shift would not change behavior. This does not match the target bug pattern (no loss of bits before widening) and is not a real bug.
