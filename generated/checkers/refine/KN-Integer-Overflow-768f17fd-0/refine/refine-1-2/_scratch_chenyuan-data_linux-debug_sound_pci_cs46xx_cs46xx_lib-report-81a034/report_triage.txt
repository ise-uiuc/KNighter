- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The target bug pattern requires a 32-bit left shift whose result is only widened to 64-bit afterward, causing the shift to be evaluated in 32-bit and potentially overflow before assignment to a u64. In the reported code:
  - pfie is an unsigned int (32-bit).
  - snd_cs46xx_peekâ€™s second parameter is a 32-bit offset (u32).
  - The expression (cpcm->pcm_channel->pcm_reader_scb->address + 1) << 2 is used directly as a 32-bit offset; there is no widening to 64-bit anywhere in this path.
  - Therefore, the reported site does not match the 32-to-64-bit shift/widening bug pattern. Even aside from the pattern mismatch, this shift is intended to convert a word index to a byte offset (<< 2) and remains within 32-bit register space; casting to u64 would be unnecessary and inappropriate for the calleeâ€™s u32 parameter.

Hence, this is a false positive with respect to the specified bug pattern and not a real bug.
