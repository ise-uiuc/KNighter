Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker currently reports any 32-bit shift whose result flows into a 64-bit destination, including function arguments. On LP64 platforms, parameters of type “unsigned long” are 64-bit, and drivers often pass 32-bit register offsets to such functions. The reported cs46xx case passes a 32-bit offset ((address + 1) << 2) to a function that likely takes an address/offset parameter typed as “unsigned long” on LP64; no 64-bit math was intended, so this is a false positive for the intended pattern.
- Fix:
  - Keep reporting the intended cases (initialization/assignment/return into true 64-bit values) as before.
  - For call arguments, add suppression heuristics:
    1) Suppress when the destination parameter is a “long” (signed/unsigned) integer (the LP64 widening-to-64-bit case), because that commonly denotes addresses/offsets.
    2) Suppress when the parameter name suggests it is an address/offset/register (e.g., “addr”, “address”, “offset”, “reg”, “index”, “port”, “ofs”, “bar”).
    3) Suppress when the callee name suggests I/O/register access (e.g., contains “read”, “write”, “peek”, “poke”, “in”, “out”, “io”, “reg”).
    4) For arguments only, additionally suppress when the shift amount is a small constant (<= 3), which typically indicates word/line-size conversion (e.g., << 2) used for register offsets.
  - Retain existing filters: top-level-only shift, existing constant-result safety, and explicit cast detection.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We still warn for assignments/initializations/returns into explicit 64-bit integers (e.g., u64/uint64_t/unsigned long long), preserving detection of the i915 tau4 bug.
  - We still warn for function arguments that are fixed 64-bit types (e.g., unsigned long long), not LP64 “long”, and which don’t look like address/offset parameters or register access helpers.
  - These heuristics aim to reduce false positives in driver-style code that passes 32-bit offsets to LP64-long parameters, while maintaining true-positive detection in genuinely wide arithmetic contexts.
- Compatibility: Uses only Clang-18 APIs and keeps all existing includes.
