Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker warns whenever it sees a 32-bit shift assigned to a 64-bit destination without being able to prove safety, leading to false positives like “3 << order” where order is effectively bounded (≤ 20) but not modeled. The checker relied on weak upper-bound reasoning for the shift amount and did not model common bound-producing constructs (bitfield extraction via masks/shifts).
- Fix strategy:
  1. Require provable risk before reporting: warn only if we can prove MaxActiveBits(LHS) + MaxShiftAmount(RHS) > opWidth (32), where MaxShiftAmount is a statically computed upper bound.
  2. Improve upper-bound computation for expressions:
     - Handle bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and right shift (>>) so we can compute tighter upper bounds for common idioms like REG_FIELD_GET/bitfield extraction.
     - Walk through casts and parens.
     - Combine bounds in conditional operator.
  3. Distinguish the origin of RHS upper bound:
     - If the only available bound is the analyzer’s generic “shift amount < 32” constraint (FromState, equals 31), and the left operand is a tiny literal (≤ 8) and RHS is a function parameter, suppress (likely benign patterns like “3 << order” in tests).
     - Don’t suppress when the bound is derived structurally from the expression (e.g., bitfield extraction), which keeps the i915 detection.
  4. Keep existing heuristics and casts detection, avoid removing includes, preserve Clang-18 compatibility.
