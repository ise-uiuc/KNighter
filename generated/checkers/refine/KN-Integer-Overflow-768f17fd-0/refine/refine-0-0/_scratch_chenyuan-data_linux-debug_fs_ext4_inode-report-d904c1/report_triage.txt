- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line calls EXT4_C2B(sbi, used). In ext4, this macro is defined to ensure the shift is performed in 64-bit width when bigalloc is enabled:
  - With CONFIG_EXT4_BIGALLOC: EXT4_C2B(sbi, c) is defined as ((ext4_fsblk_t)(c) << (sbi)->s_cluster_bits), i.e., the left operand is cast to ext4_fsblk_t (a 64-bit type) before the shift. Thus, the shift is evaluated in 64 bits and cannot overflow/truncate as a 32-bit shift.
  - Without CONFIG_EXT4_BIGALLOC: EXT4_C2B(sbi, c) reduces to (c), i.e., no shift occurs at all.

  At this call site, the analyzer flags a 32-bit shift then widening, but that would only be true if the macro lacked the 64-bit cast. In the kernel’s ext4 headers, the cast precedes the shift, so the warning is spurious. Additionally, the function argument type (qsize_t) is 64-bit, but the crucial point is that the macro already performs the shift in 64-bit width, so there is no pre-shift truncation.

  This does not match the target bug pattern of “left-shifting a 32-bit expression and only widening after the shift.” There is no real bug here, and no analogous fix (adding a cast before the shift) is needed or present.
