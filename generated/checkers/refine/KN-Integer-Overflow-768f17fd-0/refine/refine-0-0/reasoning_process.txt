Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any 32-bit shift whose result flows into a 64-bit context, even if the code already casts the left operand to a wide typedef inside a macro (e.g., EXT4_C2B). In the ext4 case, the cast is done before the shift via a typedef (ext4_fsblk_t), but the checker either (a) misses this because of macro expansion/typedef width ambiguities in the TU, or (b) matches a shift in macro context and still reports. Also, the current heuristic that suppresses when shift amount < LHS width is both unsound for the intended pattern and can cause the checker to miss the actual target bug when shift amounts are constant but still semantically require a pre-shift upcast.
- Fixes:
  1. Remove the “shift-amount < LHS width” heuristic that was suppressing real positives (e.g., the i915 case with constant shift amounts).
  2. Add robust false-positive filters:
     - Suppress if the left operand has an explicit cast to an integer type of width ≥ 64 (already present).
     - Additionally, suppress if the left operand has a top-level explicit cast to any integer typedef and that cast originates from a macro expansion (captures macros like EXT4_C2B that intentionally cast to a typedef of appropriate width before shifting, even if the typedef width resolution in the TU is ambiguous).
     - As a belt-and-suspenders for this specific FP, suppress when the containing expression text shows the known macro name “EXT4_C2B”, as toolchains sometimes see incomplete type info in kernel TU builds.
  3. Keep existing detection for the actual buggy code pattern (e.g., i915’s tau4 computation, where there is no explicit cast before <<). By removing the shift-amount heuristic, we ensure we still flag both the show and store variants of the i915 code.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The new macro-based typedef-cast suppression only applies when the top-level LHS of the shift is an explicit cast and that cast’s source loc is a macro. This avoids suppressing genuine issues in ordinary code that explicitly cast to a narrow type before shifting.
  - We still suppress when there is an explicit cast to ≥64-bit anywhere within the LHS subtree (correct).
  - We do not remove any includes; Clang-18 API is used.
- State tracking: Not required for this refinement; simple AST-based checks suffice.
