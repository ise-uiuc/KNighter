- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning points to size_t size = (1 << shift) * sizeof(struct neighbour *); where the shift is indeed performed in 32-bit int width because the literal 1 is an int. However, this does not constitute the target bug pattern nor a real bug here:

  - Target pattern requires a 32-bit shift whose result is then widened to 64-bit, causing truncation/overflow before assignment (e.g., assigning to u64). In this code, the shift result is then multiplied by sizeof(pointer) and assigned to size_t. While size_t is 64-bit on 64-bit platforms, the critical issue (loss of high bits due to 32-bit shift) would require shift ≥ 31, which is not feasible in this context.

  - Feasibility/bounds: shift is the log2 of the number of hash buckets for the neighbour table. It is initialized small (e.g., neigh_table_init uses neigh_hash_alloc(3)) and, in practice, is bounded by neighbour table sizing policies (gc thresholds, memory limits, and growth heuristics). Realistic shifts remain far below 31; allocating 2^31 buckets is impossible under the kernel’s memory constraints and far beyond configured neighbour table sizes. Thus, (1 << shift) never overflows 32-bit int in real scenarios, and there is no truncation before the multiplication/assignment.

  - Even on 64-bit systems, the shift result is safely within 32-bit for all practical values of shift in this code, so there is no loss of information that a pre-shift cast would prevent. On 32-bit systems, size_t is 32-bit anyway, so the warning’s 64-bit widening premise does not apply.

  - While a stylistic change like using (size_t)1 << shift or sizeof(struct neighbour *) << shift would silence the warning and is harmless, it is not required to fix a real bug.

Given the constraints and usage in the neighbour table, this is a false positive with respect to the specified bug pattern and not a real defect.
