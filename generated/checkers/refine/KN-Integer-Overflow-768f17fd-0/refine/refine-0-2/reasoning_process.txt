Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any 32-bit left-shift found anywhere inside an expression that later flows to a 64-bit destination. This is too broad. In the false-positive case, the shift is just a subexpression of a multiplication used to compute a size; the entire expression is not the shift itself. The checker also has an over-aggressive suppression heuristic that ignores cases solely because the shift amount is less than the operand width, which can miss true positives.
- Fixes:
  1) Only report when the shift expression is the top-level expression being assigned/returned/passed (ignoring only parens/implicit casts). This removes the FP for size_t size = (1 << shift) * sizeof(...), while keeping detection for the target buggy pattern u64 tau4 = ((1 << x_w) | x) << y.
  2) Replace the coarse suppression “shift amount < LHS width” with a precise constant-bound check: suppress only if both LHS and RHS are compile-time constants and the highest set bit of LHS plus the shift amount fits into the LHS bitwidth. This avoids hiding true positives.
- Edge cases and regressions: The top-level requirement intentionally avoids flagging when the shift is nested inside other arithmetic; this prevents the specific FP shown while still detecting the target buggy code. Constant-bound suppression avoids masking real issues when values are not compile-time constants. Signed-negative LHS remains conservative (we warn).
- Compatibility: No API changes; remains compatible with Clang-18. No includes removed. Added small helpers only.
