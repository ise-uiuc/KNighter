Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports whenever a 32-bit left shift feeds a 64-bit destination, without considering whether the shifted value is provably still within 32-bit range on the current path. In ext4, the left operand is the constant 1 and the analyzer has already inferred the shift amount is less than 32; thus the 32-bit shift is safe, but our checker still warns.
- Fix: Add path-sensitive suppression using the constraint manager. If we can prove that:
  1) the left operand’s maximum active bit count plus
  2) the right operand’s maximum shift amount
  remains within the left operand’s bitwidth,
  then the shift is safe and we suppress the warning.
- Implementation:
  - Query program state constraints using inferSymbolMaxVal on the RHS symbol (including compound symbolic expressions) to get a max bound for the shift amount.
  - Compute an upper bound on the left operand’s active bits using either constant evaluation or the max bound on a symbol, when available.
  - If both are known, and their sum is <= the LHS bitwidth, suppress.
  - Retain previous constant-only suppression and top-level expression checks.
- Edge cases:
  - If we cannot prove safety, we still warn (no increase in false negatives).
  - We avoid over-aggressive suppression to ensure we still catch the i915 pattern; there, the checker typically cannot prove tight RHS bounds or the LHS max, so it still warns.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs and provided utility functions; no includes are removed.
