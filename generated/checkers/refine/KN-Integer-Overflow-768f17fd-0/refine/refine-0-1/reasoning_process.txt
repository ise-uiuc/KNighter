Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports on any 32-bit shift inside an expression assigned to or passed as a 64-bit type without considering path constraints. In the false positive, the analyzer already inferred that the shift amount pcr < 32, and the left operand is a constant 1. In that case, the 32-bit shift is safe and intentional (bitmask construction), but our checker ignores this information.
- Fix: Make the checker path-sensitive with respect to the shift amount and the left operand:
  - If the left operand of the shift is the literal 1 and the analyzer can prove that the right-hand shift amount is less than the promoted left-operand bit width (typically 32), suppress the warning (bitmask pattern).
  - More generally, if we can compute a safe upper bound on the shift amount from constraints and an upper bound on the left operand’s maximum bit index, and the sum stays within the promoted left-operand width, suppress.
  - Keep reporting when:
    - The shift amount may be ≥ the promoted LHS width.
    - Or the left operand has potentially large magnitude so that even a smaller shift would overflow the 32-bit width.
  - Also continue to suppress when there's an explicit cast to ≥64-bit before the shift.
- Implementation details:
  - Add utility helpers to query an upper bound for the shift amount via constraint manager (inferSymbolMaxVal) or compile-time constant evaluation, and detect literal-one bitmask pattern.
  - Add an isFalsePositive(...) gate in analyzeAndReportShiftToWide() that checks these conditions.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We only suppress when we can prove safety. In the i915 target bug, y is generally unknown at the shift point (or not bounded tightly enough), so we will not suppress and will continue to report it; thus the checker still detects the original buggy pattern.
  - For the IMA false positive, the analyzer has a path constraint pcr < 32; combined with the literal-1 left operand, the checker now suppresses the report as intended.
- Compatibility: Code uses APIs available in Clang-18; no includes were removed.
