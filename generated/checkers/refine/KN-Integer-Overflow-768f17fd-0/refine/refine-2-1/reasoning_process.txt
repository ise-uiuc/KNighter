Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker warns whenever it sees a 32-bit left-shift whose result is stored in a 64-bit destination, even if the shift amount is a small compile-time constant and the shift cannot overflow 32 bits for realistic operand ranges. In the ECDH FP, the pattern ndigits << 3 is a size conversion (digits to bytes); 3 is a small constant, and ndigits is a bounded small value, so no 32-bit overflow happens before widening. The checker currently only suppresses such cases in argument context and when it can prove safety via exact constant evaluation or recorded bounds. It also uses the original LHS type width rather than the shift expression’s promoted type width when reasoning about safety, which is semantically inaccurate.
- Fixes:
  1) Use the shift expression’s actual operation width (after promotions), not the original LHS type, when checking for “fits within width”.
  2) Track exact constants for local variables via a program state map (VarConstMap) so we can reason about expressions like (1 << x_w) when x_w is assigned 2.
  3) Introduce a small-constant-shift suppression that treats shifts by very small constants (<= 5) as benign unless we can prove risk (from a constant LHS or “forced-one” bits analysis).
  4) Implement a lightweight “forced-one” bits analysis that detects patterns like (1 << x_w) | x and computes a guaranteed minimum number of active bits, so we still report the i915 bug where y can be large and the shift may exceed 32 bits.
  5) Generalize the false positive suppression beyond “argument” context while keeping existing heuristics.
- Edge cases and regressions: The small-constant-shift suppression is gated by a “provable risk” check (constant LHS value or forced-one mask). This avoids hiding true bugs when the LHS is demonstrably large. Using the real operation width avoids spurious reports for small integer types. The added state maps and helpers maintain Clang-18 API compatibility.
- Detection of target buggy code: The i915 pattern ((1 << x_w) | x) << y remains detected because the RHS shift amount is not a small constant, and the forced-one mask identifies that at least x_w bits are set on the LHS, making overflow possible with larger y. The checker continues to report it.
