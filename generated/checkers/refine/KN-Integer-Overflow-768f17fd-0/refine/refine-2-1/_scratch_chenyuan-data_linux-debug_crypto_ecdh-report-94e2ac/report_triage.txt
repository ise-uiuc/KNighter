- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged line computes nbytes = ctx->ndigits << ECC_DIGITS_TO_BYTES_SHIFT. Here, ECC_DIGITS_TO_BYTES_SHIFT is a small compile-time constant (3), so this is equivalent to nbytes = ctx->ndigits * 8. The left operand ctx->ndigits is an unsigned int bounded by ECC_MAX_DIGITS (the maximum number of 64-bit digits supported by the ECC library). Even taking a conservative upper bound (e.g., ECC_MAX_DIGITS in the tens), ndigits << 3 stays far below 2^32, so the 32-bit shift cannot overflow or lose bits before being assigned to size_t. Thus, there is no truncation/overflow from performing the shift in 32-bit width, and casting to 64-bit before the shift would not change the result. This does not match the target bug pattern where a 32-bit shift could overflow prior to widening.
