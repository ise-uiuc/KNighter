- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning is about iint->measured_pcrs |= (0x1 << pcr). This only becomes problematic if the shift needs more than 32 bits (i.e., pcr >= 32), because 0x1 is a 32-bit int and the shift is performed in 32-bit before any widening for the OR. In IMA/TPM, pcr is a TPM PCR index and is constrained to valid PCRs (typically 0–23 for both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0). The policy code validates PCR indices, and the IMA code uses PCRs within that range. Therefore, the shift never exceeds 31, so no overflow or truncation occurs before the OR, even if measured_pcrs is a 64-bit type on 64-bit builds. On 32-bit builds, measured_pcrs is often unsigned long (32-bit), so there isn’t even a widening. This does not match the target bug pattern’s harmful scenario (where bits >32 would be lost), and the behavior would not change by casting to 64-bit before shifting. At most, using BIT(pcr) or 1UL << pcr would be a stylistic improvement.
