- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code does not match the target “log-and-continue after invalid check outside lock” pattern, nor does it present a real bug. In dlm_assert_master_handler:

  - Pointers involved:
    - res is obtained via __dlm_lookup_lockres(...) and is always guarded by if (res) before any use. All accesses to res fields are performed under res->spinlock.
    - mle is obtained under dlm->master_lock via dlm_find_mle(...). Subsequent uses of mle are guarded by explicit if (mle) checks, and updates are performed under mle->spinlock. Reads of mle->type outside mle->spinlock are acceptable because the type is set at creation and not mutated later.

  - There is no instance where the code logs an invalid parameter and then proceeds to dereference it anyway. The only “invalid” log shown (e.g., invalid name length) explicitly aborts by goto done. When an MLE is not found, the code logs this but then takes the mle == NULL branch, avoiding dereference. When res is NULL, the code skips the res-handling block entirely.

  - The flagged line BUG_ON(res->state & DLM_LOCK_RES_DIRTY) is executed inside spin_lock(&res->spinlock); it is neither a dereference following a “log-only” invalid-parameter check nor a check performed outside the protecting lock.

  - Concurrency/locking: Validation and use of shared state (res and mle fields) are performed under their respective spinlocks. There is no validation done outside the protecting lock that is then relied upon under the lock in a way that could race.

Given the control flow and locking, there is no NULL-deref or race-induced invalid access stemming from a “log-and-continue” invalid check. This is a false positive with respect to the specified bug pattern.
