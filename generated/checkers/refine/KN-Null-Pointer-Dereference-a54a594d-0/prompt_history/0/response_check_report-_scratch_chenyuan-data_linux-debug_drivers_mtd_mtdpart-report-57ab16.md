- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported site in parse_mtd_partitions does not match the target “log-and-continue after failed check, then use under lock” pattern nor is it a real bug. The only potentially NULL pointer in this context is the parser returned by mtd_part_parser_get(). The code logs using pr_debug with a NULL-safe expression (parser ? parser->name : NULL), then explicitly checks if (!parser) continue; before any use, so there is no dereference after a failed validation. The locking around the parser list is handled inside mtd_part_parser_get() via a spinlock, and the returned parser’s lifetime is pinned by try_module_get(), making dereferences outside the spinlock safe with respect to module unload. The loop variable types is ensured non-NULL by earlier assignment if the input is NULL. There is no case where an invalid parameter is only logged (without abort) and then dereferenced under a protecting lock as specified by the target bug pattern.
