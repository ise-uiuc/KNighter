- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code in get_proc_task_net does not match the target bug pattern. There is no “log-and-continue” invalid-parameter check; in fact, there is no logging at all. The code acquires rcu_read_lock(), looks up the task with pid_task(), checks task != NULL, then takes task_lock(task) before accessing task->nsproxy. It then checks ns != NULL before using ns->net_ns. This is the correct locking and NULL-check pattern: the potentially changing field (nsproxy) is read under task_lock, and it is validated before use. The preliminary NULL check on the task pointer occurs before locking but is safe and standard with RCU + task_lock usage. There is no dereference of a potentially invalid pointer nor validation outside a protecting lock followed by unsafe use. Therefore, the report is a false positive and does not fit the specified bug pattern.
