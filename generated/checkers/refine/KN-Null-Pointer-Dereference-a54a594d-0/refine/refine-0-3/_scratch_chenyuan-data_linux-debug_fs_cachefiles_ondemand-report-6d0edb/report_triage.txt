- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code path does not match the target bug pattern and does not constitute a real bug.

  - No “log-and-continue” validation: There is no invalid-parameter check that only logs and then continues. At line 338, ret is checked after calling cachefiles_ondemand_get_fd(req); on error, the code sets the object to “close” and goes directly to the error path. There is no logging-only validation followed by use.

  - No dereference-after-invalid-check under lock: The alleged dereference “under lock” does not occur. The XArray lock (xa_lock) held earlier for selecting the request is released at line 333 before any subsequent operations. In the error path (label “error”), xa_erase(&cache->reqs, id) is called; this function takes its own internal lock for the xarray but the code does not dereference req->object under that lock. The only dereference after the error is req->error assignment and complete(&req->done), which do not touch req->object.

  - Pointer feasibility: req->object is already dereferenced inside cachefiles_ondemand_get_fd(req) (e.g., object = cachefiles_grab_object(req->object, ...); cache = object->volume->cache;), so if req->object were NULL, the earlier call would have failed catastrophically before returning an error code to this site. Thus, by the time ret != 0 is checked, req->object is known to be valid on this path, and calling cachefiles_ondemand_set_object_close(req->object) is safe.

  - Target pattern mismatch: The target bug pattern requires both (1) a validation that only logs without aborting and (2) the subsequent use of the object (or its index) under a protecting lock, risking NULL deref/OOB/race. Neither condition is met here.

Given these points, the analyzer’s warning is a false positive with respect to both the actual behavior and the specified target bug pattern.
