Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker marks any null-checked pointer in an if-condition with no explicit early-exit in the then-branch as “log-and-continue,” regardless of whether it actually logs, and then reports later dereferences even when not under a protecting lock. It also doesn’t clear state at unlock and misses in-lock revalidation. This led to a false positive in cachefiles_ondemand_daemon_read(), where no “log-and-continue” pattern occurs and no dereference happens under a recognized lock.
- Fixes:
  1) Only mark pointers as “suspiciously checked outside lock” if the then-branch contains a logging call and does not early-exit.
  2) Require a real lock to be held at the moment of reporting (check LockDepth > 0).
  3) Clear SuspiciousAfterLockSet when lock depth drops to 0 to avoid stale carry-over.
  4) If a null-check with early exit happens inside a lock, remove that pointer from SuspiciousAfterLockSet (proper revalidation within the lock).
  5) Improve lock detection by checking callee identifiers in addition to source text and include common Linux XA lock helpers.
- Edge cases/regressions: This narrows reports to the intended “log-and-continue” pattern and reduces unrelated FP. It still detects the xhci buggy code (it logs with xhci_dbg, performs no early exit, then acquires spin_lock_irq and dereferences ir under the lock).
- Clang-18: The changes use existing APIs and preserve all includes.
