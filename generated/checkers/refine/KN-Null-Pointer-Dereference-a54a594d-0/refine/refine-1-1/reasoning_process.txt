Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any pointer-appearance in a branch condition (e.g. if (ptr) or mixed conditions with &&/||) as a “null-check,” without tracking the polarity (invalid branch vs valid branch). It then looks for any logging within that branch subtree. This over-approximation marks pointers as “suspicious” even when the branch is the valid path (ptr != NULL), or when the pointer-check is embedded in a conjunction. This led to marking res as suspicious in ocfs2 code and reporting a false positive on a later dereference under a lock.
- Fixes:
  1. Precisely analyze the condition to determine which branch (then or else) corresponds to the “invalid” case for the pointer. Only that branch is inspected for “log-and-continue.”
  2. Support the disjunction form if (!ptr || ...) by treating the invalid branch as the then-branch when one of the disjuncts is a negative null-check. Reject conjunctions (&&) to avoid ambiguity and reduce FPs.
  3. Require the invalid branch to contain a logging call and to not contain an early exit or an aborting call (noreturn, BUG, panic, etc.).
  4. Inside a lock, if we observe a re-validation of the same pointer where the invalid branch exits (return/goto/BUG/noreturn), clear suspicion (as a sanitizer), using the same polarity-aware logic.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We only accept simple null checks: !ptr, ptr == NULL, NULL == ptr, ptr != NULL, and raw if (ptr). We intentionally avoid treating && as a valid null-check to prevent FPs.
  - We support || when one disjunct is a negative null-check (!ptr or ptr == NULL), mapping the invalid branch to then.
  - We add abort detection (noreturn/BUG/panic) to avoid flagging cases that really abort, preventing spurious reports.
- Maintain Clang-18 compatibility: Only use APIs available in Clang-18; keep all existing includes. Added helpers are internal; we preserve existing checker interface and registration.
- Detection of the original xhci bug: The pattern if (!ir || ir->intr_num == 0 || ir->intr_num >= ...) log; then lock; then ir->intr_num fits our logic precisely. The invalid branch is the then-branch (due to !ir in an ||), contains logging without early exit, and dereference occurs under lock.
