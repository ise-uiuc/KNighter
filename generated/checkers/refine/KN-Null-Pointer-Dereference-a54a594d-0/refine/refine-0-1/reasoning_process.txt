Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker marks any null-check without early exit as suspicious, regardless of whether it's just a "log-and-continue" and regardless of where subsequent dereferences occur. It also doesn't ensure the dereference is outside the original if-then branch nor that the then-branch contains logging. This led to a false positive in proc_net.c where there was no logging and the dereference occurred inside the same if-then, properly synchronized.
- Fixes:
  1. Only consider an invalid-parameter check suspicious if the then-branch contains a logging call (heuristics for Linux kernel logging: printk, pr_*, dev_*, netdev_*, xhci_dbg/err/warn, WARN/WARN_ON/etc.) and lacks an early exit.
  2. Track the Then statement of the IfStmt that formed the suspicion in a state map MemRegion -> Then Stmt.
  3. When attempting to report, filter out cases where the dereference occurs inside the same Then branch (often the correct pattern with proper locking within the branch).
  4. Report only when a recognized lock was acquired after the suspicious check (ensured by our AfterLockSet) and current LockDepth > 0, keeping the original target detection intact.
- Edge cases and regressions considered:
  - Maintains detection of xhci bug (then-branch logs via xhci_dbg without early return; later spin_lock_* and deref outside the if-then).
  - Avoids false positives when the code logs and immediately returns, or when deref happens inside the same if-then after acquiring the lock in the branch, or when there is no logging at all (as in the reported proc_net.c).
  - Keeps Clang-18 compatibility, uses provided utilities, avoids removing any includes.
