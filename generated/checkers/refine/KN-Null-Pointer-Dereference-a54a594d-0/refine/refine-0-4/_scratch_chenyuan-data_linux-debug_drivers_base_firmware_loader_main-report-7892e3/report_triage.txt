- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code does not match the target bug pattern and does not exhibit a real bug. In dev_cache_fw_image():
  - There is no “invalid-parameter check that only logs but does not abort.” No logging-based validation occurs before dereferencing.
  - The dereference of fce->name for __fw_entry_found() happens while holding fwc->name_lock, which is the intended protecting lock for the fw_names list, matching the expected locking discipline.
  - fce is guaranteed non-NULL at the point it is dereferenced: entries are created via alloc_fw_cache_entry() and only added to the todo list if allocation (including fce->name) succeeded. Inside the loop, fce is only set to NULL after being freed in the “already found” branch, and thereafter it is only used in an if (fce) condition before potentially passing to async_schedule_domain. There is no dereference of fce after it may have been set to NULL.
  - Lifetime and concurrency are respected: fce is local to this function’s todo processing, is protected by name_lock when added to the shared list, and is freed under the lock in the duplicate case.

Given these facts, the reported “invalid-checked pointer is logged but not aborted; later dereferenced under lock” pattern does not exist here. This is a false positive.
