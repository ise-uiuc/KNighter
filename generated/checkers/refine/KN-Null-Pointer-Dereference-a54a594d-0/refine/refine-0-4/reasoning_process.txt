Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: the checker was overly permissive in two places:
  1) It treated any if (ptr) truthiness check as an “invalid-null check” and also accepted ptr != NULL comparisons, which correspond to the valid (non-null) case. That made it mark benign branches as suspicious.
  2) It treated any function with a dev_ prefix as a “logging” API, causing many non-logging helper calls to be misclassified as “log-only,” which led to false positives.

- Fixes:
  1) Tighten the pointer-null condition extractor to only return a tracked pointer when the condition is true for the pointer being NULL: i.e., only for '!ptr' and 'ptr == NULL'. Do not match 'if (ptr)' or 'ptr != NULL'.
  2) Narrow logging detection to real logging APIs (pr_*, printk, dev_err/dev_warn/dev_info/dev_notice/dev_dbg, xhci_dbg, and generic names containing dbg/warn/err/log). Remove broad dev_* matching.
  3) Require the then-branch to be “log-only” by ensuring it contains at least one logging call and no other side-effecting operations (assignments, increments, non-logging calls, etc.). This matches the target pattern precisely and filters out cases like firmware_loader where the “then” is not just logging.
  4) Keep state tracking and lock-depth logic intact to still detect the xhci target bug.

- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Conditions using ptr != NULL and if (ptr) will no longer be considered “invalid-null” checks, avoiding FPs.
  - If a branch logs and also does non-trivial work, we no longer flag it as “log-only,” which reduces FPs; the target buggy code logs only in the if-then, so it remains detected.
  - Lock detection and dereference recognition remain unchanged, preserving true positives like the xhci case.
