Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: the checker reports whenever it sees a “log-only invalid check” and later dereferences under a lock, without verifying that the null branch is actually feasible on the path being reported. In many kernel subsystems, the check is defensive and the pointer is never null by construction (for example, pointers to elements of driver-owned arrays), making the report a false positive.
- Fixes:
  1) Path-feasibility gate: before reporting, query the current state to see if the pointer may be null at that point. Only report when the “ptr == NULL” branch is feasible in the current path state. This significantly reduces defensive-check false positives.
  2) Domain-specific soft filter: suppress reports for allocator/initializer-like functions (alloc/init/create/setup/register) where these defensive checks are idiomatic, while retaining detection in other functions (such as xhci_remove_secondary_interrupter).
  3) Keep existing detection logic to ensure the target true positive (xhci patch) is still found.
- Edge cases:
  - We keep re-validation-under-lock suppression (early exit inside lock clears suspicion).
  - We do not remove any includes.
  - The solution maintains Clang-18 API usage.
  - We add a helper isFalsePositive() that combines both gates: “current path may have null” and “not an allocator-like function”.
