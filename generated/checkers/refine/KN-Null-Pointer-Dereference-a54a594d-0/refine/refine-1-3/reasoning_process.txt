Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker assumed the "then" branch of an if-statement is the invalid/error branch. This caused it to mark a pointer as suspicious when encountering patterns like if (ptr) { dbg(...) }, where logging occurs on the valid branch, not on the invalid one. In JFFS2, this led to marking jeb as suspicious even though the log was executed when jeb was non-null, and the code was already under a lock held on function entry.
- Fix:
  1) Model the polarity of the null-check and identify which branch (then or else) represents the invalid/error case. Only consider that branch when looking for “log-and-continue.”
  2) Require the logging call to appear on the invalid branch specifically and that this branch lacks an early exit.
  3) Keep existing lock tracking and dereference detection intact to preserve true positives (e.g., the xhci bug).
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - Handle compound conditions like if (!ptr || ...) by preferring negative null checks;
  - For if (ptr) or if (ptr != NULL) only consider else as invalid branch;
  - If the invalid branch is missing (no else), do not mark suspicious.
- Maintain Clang-18 API compatibility and do not remove any existing #includes.
