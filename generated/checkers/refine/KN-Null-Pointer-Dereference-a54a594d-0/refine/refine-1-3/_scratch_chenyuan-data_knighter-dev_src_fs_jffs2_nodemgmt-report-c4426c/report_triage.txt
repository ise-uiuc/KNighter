- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code does not match the target bug pattern and does not present a real bug. In jffs2_do_reserve_space(), the pointer jeb is derived from c->nextblock while both c->alloc_sem and c->erase_completion_lock are held. All dereferences of jeb are guarded by checks ensuring jeb is non-NULL (e.g., if (jeb && ...)), and when jeb becomes NULL, the code handles it by finding a new nextblock and restarting. The flagged dereference at line 436 (waste = jeb->free_size) occurs after temporarily dropping and reacquiring erase_completion_lock, but c->alloc_sem remains held across this window, which the code comment explicitly cites as preventing meaningful concurrent changes. There is no instance of an “invalid-parameter check that only logs but does not abort, then dereferences anyway” outside the protecting lock. The only logging present (e.g., pr_warn when free_size is unexpected) is followed by a controlled recovery path (goto restart), not an unsafe dereference. Therefore, the report neither matches the specified bug pattern nor indicates a real null-deref/race issue.
