Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker promotes any null-checked pointer to “suspicious” without requiring a logging call, and migrates all such pointers to “after-lock” state on any lock acquisition seen anywhere (including inside callees). It also reports dereferences without verifying that a lock is currently held in the same stack frame. This leads to the reported false positive in mtdpart.c where:
  - The pointer types is legitimately re-initialized in the then-branch (no logging, no bug), yet was tracked as suspicious.
  - A lock acquired in a different function (via an inlined callee) could migrate the suspicious state and later trigger a spurious report even when the deref is not under a lock.
- Fixes:
  1) Require a logging call in the then-branch to classify a null check as “log-and-continue”.
  2) Do not mark as suspicious if the then-branch writes to the pointer itself (e.g., fixes it by assignment).
  3) Track lock depth per stack frame (not globally), and only migrate suspicious pointers to “after-lock” for the same frame.
  4) Require that the actual dereference occurs while a lock is currently held in the same stack frame.
- Checker changes:
  - Replace global set-based tracking with per-frame maps:
    - SuspiciousNoLockMap: Region -> StackFrameContext*.
    - SuspiciousAfterLockMap: Region -> StackFrameContext*.
    - FrameLockDepthMap: StackFrameContext* -> unsigned.
  - Add helpers: containsLoggingCall, thenWritesToVar, get/set frame lock depth, and frame-aware membership checks.
- Edge cases:
  - Re-initialization of the pointer (e.g., types = default_types) will not be flagged due to thenWritesToVar filter.
  - Locks taken/released only inside callees no longer spuriously migrate caller-state (we migrate only within the same StackFrameContext).
  - Reporting requires Depth(current frame) > 0 at dereference, preventing “not-under-lock” reports.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs and keeps all existing includes.
- Target bug: Still detected in xhci_remove_secondary_interrupter:
  - if (!ir || !ir->intr_num || ...) with xhci_dbg() is recognized as “log-and-continue”.
  - Lock is acquired in the same function afterward.
  - Deref under lock is reported.
