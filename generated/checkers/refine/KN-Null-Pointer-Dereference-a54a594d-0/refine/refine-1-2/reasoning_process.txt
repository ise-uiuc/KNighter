Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker assumed any “if (ptr)” is a null-check reporting the Then-branch as suspicious if it contained a logging call anywhere in its subtree, ignoring the polarity of the check. In the false positive, the invalid branch is actually the Else-branch of “if (match)”, which is absent. The logging call found was unrelated and nested in a different conditional, causing a spurious “log-and-continue” inference.
- Fix: Precisely determine which branch is the “invalid-branch” that corresponds to the pointer being NULL/invalid. Only consider a branch suspicious if:
  - It is the invalid branch (Then for “!ptr” or “ptr == NULL” or “!ptr || …”, Else for “ptr”, “ptr != NULL”, or “ptr && …”), and
  - That branch contains a logging call and lacks an early exit (return/goto/break/continue).
  If the invalid branch is missing (e.g., “if (ptr)” with no Else), do not mark suspicion.
- Maintain detection: The xhci buggy code “if (!ir || …) xhci_dbg(); lock(); ir->intr_num; …” still matches because the invalid branch is Then, it logs, there is no early exit, and later dereference happens under lock.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Compound conditions: “!ptr || …” and “ptr && …” are handled.
  - “ptr || …”: to avoid FPs, we only attribute invalid-Else conservatively (we don’t treat “||” as invalid-on-Else).
  - Revalidation inside the lock: if under lock we see the invalid-branch with early exit, we clear the suspicion for that specific pointer.
- API compatibility: No Clang-18 API changes are required; existing includes are preserved.
