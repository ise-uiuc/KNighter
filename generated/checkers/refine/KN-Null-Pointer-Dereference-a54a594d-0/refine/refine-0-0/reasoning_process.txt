Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker marks any pointer that appears in an if-condition as a “null-checked” candidate, even for positive checks like if (ptr), and regardless of whether the then-branch returns. This can leave a stale pointer tracked through to a later lock site, causing false positives such as the irqdomain.c case where if (!domain) { pr_warn(); return 0; } properly aborts, yet the checker still warned at mutex_lock(&domain->root->mutex).
- Fixes:
  1) Tighten null-check recognition to only negative null-checks: !ptr or ptr == NULL (or NULL == ptr). Remove the heuristic “if (ptr)” case entirely.
  2) Require that the “then” branch contains a logging-like call and does not contain an early exit before marking a pointer suspicious. This matches the intended “log-and-continue” pattern.
  3) If we see an early-exit null-check for the same pointer inside a lock, clear it from the after-lock set (handles the patched code where validation is moved under the lock).
  4) Only report dereferences while currently under lock (LockDepth > 0).
  5) On final lock release (LockDepth becomes 0), clear the SuspiciousAfterLockSet to avoid stale reports.
  6) If we encounter an early-exit null-check for a pointer pre-lock, explicitly remove it from the pre-lock suspicious set to avoid stale state from earlier non-aborting checks.

- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Requiring a logging call in the then-branch avoids flagging legitimate early-return validations and many benign checks, while still catching the target buggy pattern (which logs and continues).
  - Clearing sets on early-exit (both outside and inside lock) ensures we don’t carry stale state across control-flow refinements.
  - Reporting only while under lock avoids mismatched context warnings.
- Compatibility: All changes use Clang-18 APIs and keep all existing includes.
