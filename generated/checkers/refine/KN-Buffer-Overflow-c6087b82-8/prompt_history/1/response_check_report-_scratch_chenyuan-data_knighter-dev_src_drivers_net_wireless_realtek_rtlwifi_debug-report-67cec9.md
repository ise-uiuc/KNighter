- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The code clamps the user-supplied length before copying: tmp_len is set to min(count, sizeof(tmp) - 1), and then copy_from_user(tmp, buffer, tmp_len) is performed, followed by explicit NUL-termination tmp[tmp_len] = '\0'. The destination buffer tmp has size 33 (32 + 1), so the maximum copy is 32 bytes, which is within bounds and safe. This matches the correct, fixed pattern (bounded copy with NUL-termination) and does not exhibit the target bug pattern of an unchecked copy_from_user into a fixed-size buffer.
