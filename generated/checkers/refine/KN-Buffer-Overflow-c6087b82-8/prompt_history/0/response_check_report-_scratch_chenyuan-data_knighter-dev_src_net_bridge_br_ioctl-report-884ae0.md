- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged call is copy_from_user(buf, argp, IFNAMSIZ) where buf is char buf[IFNAMSIZ]. The copy length is a fixed constant equal to the destination buffer size, not a user-supplied unchecked length. Immediately after, the code enforces NUL termination with buf[IFNAMSIZ-1] = 0. This cannot overflow the buffer, and the string use is safe. This does not match the target bug pattern, which requires copying a user-specified length into a fixed-size buffer without clamping. Additionally, an identical pattern appears elsewhere in the same file and is standard practice. Therefore, this is a false positive.
