Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker records “safe length” variables only when it can obtain a MemRegion from the sizeof argument via ProgramState. In sizeof(...) the argument is in unevaluated context, so State->getSVal(...) often returns UnknownVal, making getMemRegionFromExpr() return nullptr. As a result, the checker fails to associate len = min(count, sizeof(buf) - 1) with buf, and later warns at copy_from_user(buf, user, len), causing the false positive.
- Fixes:
  1. Teach the checker to obtain the array’s VarRegion directly from the AST (DeclRefExpr -> VarDecl -> RegionManager::getVarRegion) as a fallback when the region cannot be retrieved from program state in unevaluated contexts (sizeof argument).
  2. Use the same fallback in exprContainsSizeofOfArray so that inline uses like copy_from_user(buf, user, min(count, sizeof(buf)-1)) are handled as well.
  3. On reassignments to the previously “safe” length variable, drop the association if the new RHS no longer contains a sizeof of any array, to avoid suppressing real bugs after the variable is overwritten.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The new mapping only applies when we do see sizeof(arr) in the RHS, including inside min/macros or inlined expressions; does not create extra false negatives.
  - We do not relax other safety checks; we still report when the length could exceed the array or lacks a clamp to sizeof(array)-1.
  - Compatible with Clang-18 API; no includes removed.
- Maintains detection of the target buggy pattern: copy_from_user(mybuf, buf, nbytes) stays reported since no association is recorded for nbytes.
