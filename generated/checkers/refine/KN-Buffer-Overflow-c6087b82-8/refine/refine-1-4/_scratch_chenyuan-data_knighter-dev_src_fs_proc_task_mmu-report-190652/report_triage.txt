- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The code clamps the user-supplied count before the copy: if (count > sizeof(buffer) - 1) count = sizeof(buffer) - 1;, then uses that bounded count in copy_from_user. The destination buffer is also zero-initialized (char buffer[PROC_NUMBUF] = {}), ensuring NUL-termination after copying up to size-1 bytes. This prevents overflow and supports safe string parsing via strstrip/kstrtoint. Therefore, the report does not match the target bug pattern of an unchecked copy_from_user into a fixed-size buffer.
