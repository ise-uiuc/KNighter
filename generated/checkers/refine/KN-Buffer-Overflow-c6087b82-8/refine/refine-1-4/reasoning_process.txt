Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker relies on MemRegion extraction from expressions inside sizeof() and from the destination argument. For sizeof(array) the expression is unevaluated, and getMemRegionFromExpr often yields null or a different “shape” than the region derived from the destination expression. As a result, the checker fails to correlate a clamp assignment (count = sizeof(buf) - 1) with the subsequent copy_from_user(..., count), and incorrectly warns. Additionally, the checker does not clear stale mappings when the “length” variable is later reassigned to a non-sizeof value.
- Fixes:
  1) Robustly identify the array by its VarDecl, not just MemRegion, and store an auxiliary map keyed by the array VarDecl to the length variable region. This avoids region shape mismatches and unevaluated expression issues in sizeof().
  2) Improve detection of “sizeof of this array” by comparing the VarDecl of sizeof’s argument to the destination’s VarDecl, not just MemRegion equality.
  3) On assignments, set both region-based and VarDecl-based maps when we detect a sizeof(array) use; clear stale mappings when the same length variable is reassigned without a sizeof(array).
  4) Keep using constraint-based reasoning to accept paths where count <= sizeof(buf) - 1 is known via branch conditions.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The checker still reports when there is no clamp.
  - It avoids turning off warnings generally: mappings are strictly tied to the same array VarDecl, and stale mappings are cleared if the variable is overwritten later.
  - Maintains Clang-18 API compatibility and does not remove any existing include. We add a safe extra include for MemRegion access.
