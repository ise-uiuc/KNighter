Refinement Plan:
- Root cause:
  - The checker identifies copy functions using substring matching on the source text, so it falsely matches copy_from_user_nmi as copy_from_user.
  - The checker requires the copy length to be <= sizeof(array) - 1 unconditionally, assuming the destination is a C-string. This triggers a false positive when the copy is binary-safe at exactly sizeof(array), as in arch/x86/events/utils.c.

- Fixes:
  1) Tighten function matching: use callee identifier equality; on fallback to source-text, match whole token boundaries so that copy_from_user_nmi no longer matches copy_from_user.
  2) Separate overflow from NUL-termination concerns. For overflow, copying up to and including sizeof(array) is safe. Accept length <= sizeof(array). Keep array-1 only for string-specific checks (not implemented here), which avoids the false positive but retains detection of the target bug (unchecked nbytes).
  3) Enhance constant and symbolic reasoning:
     - Treat constant lengths equal to sizeof(array) as safe.
     - If the max value of length symbol is known and <= sizeof(array), treat as safe.
     - Still report when max value can exceed sizeof(array) or when length is unconstrained/unknown (which covers the target buggy pattern).
  4) Maintain existing state tracking (ArraySafeLenMap, BoundedLenSyms) and logic to treat sizeof-based or min(sizeof, nbytes) bounds as safe.
  5) Do not remove any includes; keep Clang-18 API usage.

- Edge cases and regressions:
  - This change reduces warnings where the copy length equals the exact buffer size but the buffer is used as binary data. It continues to warn when the length can exceed the buffer size, including the original buggy code with nbytes from userspace.
  - The checker still recognizes min(sizeof(buf), nbytes) patterns as safe via existing mechanisms.
  - Exact-matching of function names avoids spurious matches while keeping coverage by explicitly listing known variants (copy_from_user, __copy_from_user, raw_copy_from_user, copy_from_user_nmi).
