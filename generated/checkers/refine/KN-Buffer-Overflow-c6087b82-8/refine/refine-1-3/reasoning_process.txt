Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: At the call site, the length argument is a scalar rvalue variable (e.g., “len”), and getMemRegionFromExpr() returns no MemRegion for rvalues. Our checker only accepted the case if the region of the length variable matched the one previously recorded from the assignment “len = min(count, sizeof(buf) - 1)”. Because we failed to recover the variable’s MemRegion from the rvalue expression, we missed the “safe” association and reported a false positive.
- Fixes:
  1) Improve getLenArgRegionOrSymbol() to also recover the VarRegion for rvalue DeclRefExpr via RegionManager::getVarRegion(VarDecl, LCtx). This lets us match the pre-recorded array→length-var-region association.
  2) Add a secondary, symbol-based association: When we detect “len = ... sizeof(buf) ...” in checkBind, also record the LHS SymbolRef in a new ProgramState map keyed by the destination array’s MemRegion. In checkPreCall, if the current length argument’s SymbolRef matches the recorded symbol for that array, treat it as safe. This is robust even if region recovery fails for some reason.
- Edge cases:
  - Multiple arrays and different bounded variables: We key the safety to the specific destination array region, preventing cross-array false negatives.
  - Reassignments: Symbol-based association only matches if the current symbol equals the recorded one; stale mappings won’t incorrectly mark a new, unrelated value as safe.
  - Direct use of min(..., sizeof(dst)-1) at the call site remains handled by existing logic.
- Compatibility: Uses existing Clang-18 APIs. No includes removed.
- True positives: The checker still warns on unbounded copy_from_user without a sizeof(dst) bound and when the inferred max value can exceed the destination array capacity.
