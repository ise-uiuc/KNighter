Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker records a mapping from array region -> length variable region at assignment time, but at the call site it tries to recover the region for the length argument from its rvalue SVal. For scalar rvalues, getAsRegion() returns null, so the checker fails to match the recorded mapping and emits a warning even when the code clamps the length with sizeof(array)-1. Additionally, the checker recorded “safe” mappings for any RHS expression containing sizeof(array), which is too permissive.
- Fixes:
  1) Recover the MemRegion of a length variable passed by value at the call site by detecting DeclRefExpr and building its LValue region via SValBuilder::getLValue(). This lets us match the array->len mapping.
  2) Improve the logic that teaches the checker a length variable is “bounded by array size”: only record the mapping when RHS is either:
     - sizeof(array) or sizeof(array) - const, or
     - a min-like ternary clamp (X > UB ? UB : X), where UB is sizeof(array) or sizeof(array) - const.
     - keep the previous heuristic for min(...) macros, but ensure sizeof refers to the same array when possible.
  3) Maintain a reverse map (LenReg -> ArrReg) and clear stale mappings when the length variable is reassigned to something that does not reestablish the bound, avoiding unsound persistence.
- Edge cases:
  - Handles ternary clamp without min macro (the FP case).
  - Still detects the original lpfc buggy pattern where no clamp is used.
  - Avoids over-accepting expressions that merely contain sizeof(array) but don’t bound the length.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs and keeps all existing includes.
