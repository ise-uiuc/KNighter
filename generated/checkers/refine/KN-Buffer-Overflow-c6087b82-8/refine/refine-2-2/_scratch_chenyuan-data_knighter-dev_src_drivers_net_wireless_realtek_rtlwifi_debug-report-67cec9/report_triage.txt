- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code clamps the user-supplied length to the destination buffer size and ensures NUL-termination, so it does not match the target bug pattern. Specifically, tmp is a fixed buffer of size 33 (char tmp[32 + 1]). The code sets tmp_len = min(count, sizeof(tmp) - 1), then calls copy_from_user(tmp, buffer, tmp_len), and finally sets tmp[tmp_len] = '\0'. This bounds the copy to at most 32 bytes and guarantees a terminating NUL, preventing overflow and unsafe string parsing. Therefore, the static analyzerâ€™s warning that the copy length is not bounded is a false positive, and there is no real bug here.
