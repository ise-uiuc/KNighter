Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker relies on checkBind assuming S is always the BinaryOperator of an assignment. With macros like min() (as used in the kernel), the bind callback is frequently invoked for subexpressions (e.g., branches of a conditional inside min), so RHS extraction fails and we never record that the length variable was bounded by sizeof(dest) - 1. Consequently, when seeing copy_from_user(buf, user_buf, len), the checker does not know that len was already clamped, and it emits a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1) In checkBind, robustly recover the actual assignment or declaration initializer that produced the bind by walking up to the parent BinaryOperator or DeclStmt and extracting the RHS/init expression.
  2) If the RHS/init contains sizeof(array), record a precise mapping from the destination array’s MemRegion to the length variable’s MemRegion (ArraySafeLenMap). This enables checkPreCall to recognize len as safely clamped for that specific array.
  3) Keep the existing logic that only deems safe when the length is provably bounded by the same array’s sizeof, preserving true positive detection.
- Edge cases/regressions handled:
  - Handles both assignment (len = ...) and initialization (size_t len = ...).
  - Only records safety mapping when the RHS contains sizeof(actual array), keeping precision and avoiding suppressing legitimate issues.
  - Keeps existing constant and symbolic bounds checks for true positives.
- Compatibility: No API changes beyond standard Clang 18 usage; no includes removed.
