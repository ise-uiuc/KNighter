Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker relies on extracting MemRegion from expressions inside sizeof, which is unevaluated, so getMemRegionFromExpr returns null. As a result, the checker fails to associate the destination array with the length variable when the length is computed using a conditional min-like expression that includes sizeof(array), leading to a false positive.
- Fix strategy:
  1. Track “safe length variables” using AST-only identity of the destination array (VarDecl) instead of MemRegion when sizeof is used.
  2. Record when a length variable is freshly assigned from a min-like expression involving sizeof(array) or from expressions like sizeof(array) - K. Invalidate that safety tag on subsequent reassignments that do not have the bound.
  3. At call site, accept the length variable only if:
     - We can match the destination array VarDecl and the length variable region pair in our map, and
     - The length variable is currently marked as fresh-safe (based on its most recent assignment).
  4. Improve direct detection for inline expressions (no intermediate variable) by matching sizeof of the exact array VarDecl in the third argument.
- Edge cases:
  - Use AST to locate the array VarDecl even when the destination expression is not a plain DeclRefExpr (e.g., &arr[0], arr + off).
  - Avoid misclassifying expressions like sizeof(arr) + K as safe.
  - Do not remove any existing includes; maintain Clang-18 API compliance.
- Regressions:
  - Prevent stale safe mappings by requiring the safe length variable to be “fresh” (i.e., last assignment proved bounded). Do not rely on region extracted from sizeof in unevaluated context.
