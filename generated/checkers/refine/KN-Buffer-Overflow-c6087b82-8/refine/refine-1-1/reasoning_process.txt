Refinment Plan:
- Root cause: The checker uses substring matching on source text to identify copy_from_user calls. This accidentally matches copy_from_user_nmi and similar functions. Additionally, the checker treats a constant copy length equal to the destination size as unsafe (it only accepts <= sizeof(buf) - 1), which is overly strict for raw byte copies like instruction fetches.
- Fixes:
  1. Identify copy_from_user-family calls by callee identifier (exact name) instead of substring matching. This eliminates accidental matches like copy_from_user_nmi.
  2. Treat a compile-time constant length that is equal to the array size as safe for byte copies. Keep the stricter sizeof(buf) - 1 acceptance when thatâ€™s explicitly used, but do not require -1 for all byte copies. This preserves detection of the target buggy case (user-controlled nbytes variable) since that does not fold to a constant.
  3. Keep existing conservative handling for symbolic values, with a small relaxation: if a provable max bound of the length symbol is <= sizeof(buf), consider it safe. This will not suppress the target bug since nbytes is unconstrained.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Macro-based constants (e.g., MAX_INSN_SIZE) are folded to constants and will be treated as safe if equal to the array size.
  - min(nbytes, sizeof(buf) - 1) patterns remain recognized via checkBind heuristics and exprContainsSizeofOfArray.
  - No change in includes and Clang-18 API usage.
- Regressions: Minimal. The checker becomes stricter in recognizing exact function names and more accurate in exempting constant-length copies that are within buffer bounds.
