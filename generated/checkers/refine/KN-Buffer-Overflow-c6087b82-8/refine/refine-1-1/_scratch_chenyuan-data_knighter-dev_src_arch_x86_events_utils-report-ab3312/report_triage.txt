- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported site copies into a fixed-size local buffer declared as u8 buf[MAX_INSN_SIZE]; and the copy length passed to copy_from_user_nmi is exactly MAX_INSN_SIZE. Therefore, the copy length is statically bounded by the destination buffer size and cannot overflow the buffer. Moreover, the data being copied are instruction bytes (not a string), so NUL-termination is irrelevant. The code also correctly handles partial copies via bytes_left and uses bytes_read to bound subsequent decoding. This does not match the target bug pattern of copying an unchecked, user-supplied length into a fixed buffer.
