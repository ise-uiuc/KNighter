Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats only lengths <= sizeof(dest) - 1 as “safe” and flags lengths equal to the destination size. In the false positive, copy_from_user(buf, argp, IFNAMSIZ) copies exactly the buffer size into char buf[IFNAMSIZ], which is safe from an overflow perspective. Our checker incorrectly required a spare byte for NUL, conflating overflow checks with string-termination policy.
- Fix:
  - Separate “overflow safety” from “string-termination” concerns. For overflow detection, accept lengths <= sizeof(dest) as safe.
  - Adjust the constant and symbolic upper-bound checks to use ArraySize, not ArraySize - 1.
  - Keep existing logic that recognizes sizeof(dest) in the length expression and bounded symbols.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - This change only relaxes the safe-condition boundary by 1 byte, eliminating false positives for correct calls with exact size while still flagging truly unbounded copies when length may exceed the buffer.
  - The target buggy pattern with unchecked user-supplied nbytes is still detected because the length is symbolic with no bounding relation to the destination size.
- Compatibility: No API changes beyond Clang-18 usage; includes unchanged.
