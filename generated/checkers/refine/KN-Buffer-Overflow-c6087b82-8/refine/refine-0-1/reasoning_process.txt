Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker unconditionally required the length to be bounded by sizeof(array) - 1 (leaving space for a NUL terminator), which is only necessary for subsequent string use. In the false positive case, the code copies instruction bytes into a fixed-size buffer using a compile-time constant equal to the buffer size (MAX_INSN_SIZE). This is perfectly safe for non-string data, but the checker flagged it because it did not see sizeof(buf) nor the -1 guard.
- Fixes:
  1) Treat copies as safe if the third argument evaluates to a compile-time constant less than or equal to the destination array size. This preserves safety against overflow and eliminates this FP.
  2) Expand isCopyFromUser to recognize copy_from_user_nmi explicitly (though substring already matched it) to be robust and intentional.
  3) Keep the sizeof(array) and min(..., sizeof(array) - 1) tracking as-is, but change the general safe limit to sizeof(array) (not sizeof(array) - 1). This retains detection of true unbounded copies, while not imposing the NUL-termination requirement on non-string data paths.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - This change eliminates FPs where a constant bound equal to the array size is used.
  - It still detects the target buggy pattern in lpfc_debugfs_lockstat_write, where nbytes (tainted/user-controlled) was passed directly without bounding. After the patch, our existing min(..., sizeof(buf)-1) recognition continues to mark the new code as safe.
  - We continue to warn when a constant bound is strictly greater than the array size or when the symbolic upper bound can exceed the array size.
- Clang-18 compatibility: All APIs used are available; no includes were removed.
