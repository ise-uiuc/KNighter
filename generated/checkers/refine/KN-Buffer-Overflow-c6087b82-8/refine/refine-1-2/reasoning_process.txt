Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker tries to prove safety via a region-to-region mapping (ArraySafeLenMap) but fails to retrieve the region of the length argument when it is used as an rvalue (e.g., a DeclRefExpr “tmp_len” used as an argument). getMemRegionFromExpr(State->getSVal(...).getAsRegion()) returns null for rvalues, so the checker misses the previously computed bounded length and reports a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1) Robustly obtain the VarRegion from a DeclRefExpr even when it appears as an rvalue.
  2) Record, in checkBind, both:
     - The length variable’s region, and
     - The symbolic value representing the computed bounded length (created by the sizeof(...) expression)
     for the destination array. This allows the checker to later verify that the call uses exactly that “safe” symbol.
  3) In checkPreCall, don’t treat region equality alone as proof of safety (which can be stale if the variable is reassigned). Instead, prefer matching the symbol of the argument against the stored “safe” symbol; fall back to other existing checks (direct sizeof in the argument, constant evaluation, and max-value inference).
  4) Improve getLenArgRegionOrSymbol to handle DeclRefExpr and retrieve the VarRegion robustly via SValBuilder::getLValue(...) so the earlier mapping is usable.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - If the length variable is reassigned after the safe assignment, we won’t accept it as safe unless its current symbol matches the stored safe symbol; this avoids false negatives and stale-region false positives.
  - Existing true positives (like the lpfc case) still trigger because there is no bounding using sizeof(buf) and no safe symbol recorded.
  - Heuristics for min()/sizeof() stay intact; we keep BoundedLenSyms to reduce false positives in macro-heavy cases.
- API: Uses Clang-18-stable APIs (CheckerContext, SValBuilder::getLValue, ProgramState maps).
