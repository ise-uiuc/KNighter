Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treated copies as safe only if the length argument was provably <= sizeof(dest) - 1. This is too strict for the “unbounded length” check and caused a false positive when the code performed copy_from_user(buf, ..., IFNAMSIZ) into char buf[IFNAMSIZ]. Copying exactly the buffer size is bounded and not an overflow.
- Fix: Relax the bound check to accept any length provably <= sizeof(dest). Keep the existing heuristics for min(..., sizeof(...)-1) and sizeof(...) tracking. This preserves detection of the real issue where the length is user-controlled and unbounded by the destination size.
- Specific changes:
  1) Replace SafeCopyLimit = ArraySize - 1 with a bound of ArraySize in the decision logic.
  2) Add a helper isLenProvablyLE() that proves Len <= sizeof(dest) using either constant evaluation or max-value constraints.
  3) Keep the existing state tracking (ArraySafeLenMap, BoundedLenSyms). Still consider “min(..., sizeof(...))” or “min(..., sizeof(...)-1)” as safe.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Constants (macros) equal to the array size (e.g., IFNAMSIZ) are now correctly accepted.
  - If the analyzer can prove Len’s maximum value is <= sizeof(dest), we accept it.
  - If Len’s maximum is > sizeof(dest), we still report.
  - If neither proof holds, we still warn.
- Clang-18 API compatibility: The changes only adjust checker logic and keep the original includes and APIs unchanged.
- The checker still detects the target buggy code: copy_from_user(mybuf, buf, nbytes) where nbytes is user-controlled and not clamped; the analyzer won’t be able to prove Len <= sizeof(mybuf), so it continues to warn.
