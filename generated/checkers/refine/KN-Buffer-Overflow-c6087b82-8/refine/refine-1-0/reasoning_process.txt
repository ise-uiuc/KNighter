Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treated lengths greater than sizeof(dest)-1 as unsafe by default, enforcing a “-1” rule intended for NUL-terminated strings. This caused a false positive when the length equals the destination array size (e.g. IFNAMSIZ), which is safe and commonly followed by explicit manual termination (buf[IFNAMSIZ-1] = 0). Additionally, exprContainsSizeofOfArray returned “safe” if sizeof(array) simply appeared anywhere in the length expression, which could mask real bugs like sizeof(buf) + 4.
- Fixes:
  1) Treat copy_from_user length <= sizeof(dest) as safe. The checker should only require -1 when it can prove subsequent string use requires it; otherwise, enforcing -1 universally creates false positives.
  2) Tighten the “sizeof in length” heuristic: Only accept safe forms: sizeof(array) exactly, sizeof(array) - K (K >= 0), or min(..., sizeof(array) [or sizeof(array) - K]). Don’t blanket-accept any expression that merely contains sizeof(array).
  3) Keep the existing state tracking for “bounded” symbols and improve constant-evaluation-based suppression for constant lengths.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The checker still reports when the user length is symbolic and not provably bounded by sizeof(dest). It also still reports when constants exceed the array size.
  - It continues to accept min(nbytes, sizeof(dest)) and min(nbytes, sizeof(dest) - 1) as safe.
  - It avoids false negatives from earlier logic that accepted any occurrence of sizeof(array).
- API compatibility: The changes keep the same includes and use standard Clang-18 Static Analyzer APIs. No removed includes, only additional helper logic.
