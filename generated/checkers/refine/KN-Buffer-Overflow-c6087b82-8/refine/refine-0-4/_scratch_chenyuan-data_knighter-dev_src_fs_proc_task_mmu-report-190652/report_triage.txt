- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The code clamps the user-supplied count to at most sizeof(buffer) - 1 before copy_from_user, ensuring the copy length never exceeds the destination buffer and leaving space for a terminating NUL. The buffer is zero-initialized (char buffer[PROC_NUMBUF] = {}), so it is guaranteed to be NUL-terminated after the copy. The subsequent string use (strstrip + kstrtoint) is therefore safe. This does not match the target bug pattern of an unchecked copy_from_user into a fixed-size buffer.
