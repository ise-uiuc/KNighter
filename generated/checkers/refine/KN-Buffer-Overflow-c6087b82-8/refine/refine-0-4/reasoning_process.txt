Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only uses AST-based constant evaluation and a simplistic state map when identifying bounded length, but it fails to consult the analyzer’s path-sensitive constraints. In the false positive, the length variable is clamped in a conditional branch (count = sizeof(buffer) - 1). On that path, the value is known at analysis time, but the checker attempts AST constant-folding (which cannot see runtime assignments) and symbol max-bound inference (which can be null when the value is a concrete integer), so it misses the fact that count <= sizeof(buffer) - 1 is already guaranteed.
- Fix: Add a path-sensitive proof step using the constraint manager via SValBuilder and assume(). Before reporting, prove that Len <= SafeCopyLimit by constructing and checking the comparison (Len > SafeCopyLimit). If that comparison is infeasible, then the call is safe and no warning should be emitted.
- Keep and reuse existing state tracking (ArraySafeLenMap and BoundedLenSyms). Add a new helper isLenProvedLEViaState to encapsulate the check.
- Consider edge cases:
  - If Len becomes a concrete value due to prior assignments (e.g., from the true branch of the clamp), the new check will prove safety.
  - If the clamp is enforced by an early-return guard (e.g., return if count > limit), the new check also proves safety.
  - No regression on true positives: If no clamp exists, constraints won’t prove Len <= SafeCopyLimit and the checker still warns.
- Maintain Clang-18 API (use SValBuilder::evalBinOp and ProgramState::assume with getConditionType()).
- Do not remove any includes.
