- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning is reported at bnxt_vf_set_link() (line ~1130), but that function does not call hwrm_req_init() at all, so it cannot violate the “init must be followed by drop on all exits” rule. The only nearby hwrm_req_init() calls are in helper functions such as bnxt_hwrm_fwd_resp() and bnxt_hwrm_exec_fwd_resp(). Those helpers do a simple init + send sequence and do not call hwrm_req_hold() or hwrm_req_replace(). In the bnxt HWRM API usage, hwrm_req_drop() is required when a response buffer is held (via hwrm_req_hold()) or when the request buffer is kept across operations (e.g., hwrm_req_replace()). This is evidenced in the same file by bnxt_hwrm_func_qcfg_flags(), which uses hwrm_req_hold() and correctly calls hwrm_req_drop(), while multiple other functions perform init + send without drop. There is no exit after a successful hwrm_req_init() in bnxt_vf_set_link(), nor a missed drop in a path that used hold/replace. Therefore, the report does not match the target bug pattern and indicates no real leak here.
