- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The reported location (include/linux/bitmap.h:334) is clearly misattributed, as bitmap helpers have nothing to do with the HWRM request lifecycle. However, within the annotated snippet, there is a real instance that exactly matches the target bug pattern: in bnxt_fw_echo_reply(), the code does:
  - rc = hwrm_req_init(bp, req, HWRM_FUNC_ECHO_RESPONSE);
  - if (rc) return;
  - hwrm_req_send(bp, req);
  - and then returns without ever calling hwrm_req_drop(bp, req).
  This is a straightforward leak of the HWRM request buffer if hwrm_req_init() succeeds. Other bnxt functions (e.g., bnxt_update_link(), bnxt_hwrm_get_wol_fltrs(), bnxt_hwrm_phy_qcaps) properly call hwrm_req_drop() on all exit paths after a successful hwrm_req_init(), reinforcing that the drop is required. The missing drop in bnxt_fw_echo_reply() matches the specified target pattern and constitutes a real resource leak; the correct fix is to call hwrm_req_drop(bp, req) after hwrm_req_send(), regardless of the send outcome.
