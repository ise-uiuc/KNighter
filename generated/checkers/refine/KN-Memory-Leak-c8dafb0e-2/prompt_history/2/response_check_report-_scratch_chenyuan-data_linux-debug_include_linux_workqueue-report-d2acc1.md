- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The report flags include/linux/workqueue.h:734 (schedule_delayed_work), which contains no hwrm_req_init()/hwrm_req_drop() usage at all. Therefore, the target pattern (successful hwrm_req_init followed by an exit without hwrm_req_drop) cannot occur at the reported location. The annotated snippet appears to have spliced in unrelated bnxt driver code (which does use the HWRM helpers), but the flagged line is in a generic workqueue wrapper unrelated to HWRM request management. Given the mismatch between the reported file/line and the required pattern context, this report does not match the target bug pattern and is a false positive.
