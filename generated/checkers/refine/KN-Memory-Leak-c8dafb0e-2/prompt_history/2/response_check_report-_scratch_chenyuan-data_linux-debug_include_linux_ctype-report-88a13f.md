- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The report flags include/linux/ctype.h:45 (the inline isdigit() helper) for a missing hwrm_req_drop(), which is unrelated to HWRM request handling. Reviewing the bnxt code that actually uses hwrm_req_init() (bnxt_get_nvram_directory, bnxt_get_nvram_item, bnxt_find_nvram_item, and parts of bnxt_ethtool_init) shows proper cleanup: every path after a successful hwrm_req_init() either calls hwrm_req_drop() before returning or returns only if hwrm_req_init() itself failed. For example, dma slice allocation failures drop before returning, and after hwrm_req_send()/hwrm_req_send_silent(), hwrm_req_drop() is called unconditionally before exit. Therefore, the reported location does not match the target bug pattern and there is no real leak here.
