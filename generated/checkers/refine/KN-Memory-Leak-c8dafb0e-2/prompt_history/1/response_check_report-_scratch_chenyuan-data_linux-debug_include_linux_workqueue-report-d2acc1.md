- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The reported location (include/linux/workqueue.h:734) is spurious, but the annotated path clearly shows the real issue in the bnxt driver: function bnxt_hwrm_poll(). In bnxt_hwrm_poll(), after a successful hwrm_req_init(bp, req, HWRM_VER_GET), the code sets up the request, calls hwrm_req_send(bp, req), and then returns rc directly without calling hwrm_req_drop(bp, req) on any exit path. This exactly matches the target bug pattern: a successful hwrm_req_init() followed by an exit without hwrm_req_drop(), causing a leak of the request buffer. Other nearby functions (e.g., bnxt_queue_qportcfg) correctly use an exit label to call hwrm_req_drop() on all paths, highlighting the inconsistency. The fix would be to add hwrm_req_drop(bp, req) on all returns after a successful init (e.g., via a goto exit label), which is the standard remedy for this pattern. Therefore, this is a true positive that matches the target bug pattern and represents a real leak.
