- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported location (include/linux/bitmap.h:334) is inside the generic bitmap helper inline function bitmap_andnot(), which contains no calls to hwrm_req_init(), hwrm_req_replace(), or hwrm_req_drop(). Therefore, it cannot exhibit the target bug pattern of leaking an HWRM request by returning without hwrm_req_drop() after a successful hwrm_req_init(). The control flow shown in the annotated trace (bnxt_eee_config_ok -> linkmode_andnot -> bitmap_andnot) is unrelated to HWRM request management. While the surrounding annotated BNXT driver code contains valid hwrm_req_init()/hwrm_req_drop() usage, and there may be other places in the BNXT driver (e.g., bnxt_fw_echo_reply) that warrant review for missing hwrm_req_drop(), the specific report here does not match the target bug pattern and is thus a false positive.
