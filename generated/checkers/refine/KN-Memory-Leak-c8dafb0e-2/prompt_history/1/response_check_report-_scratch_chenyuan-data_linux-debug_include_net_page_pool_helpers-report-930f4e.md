- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported location is in include/net/page_pool/helpers.h within page_pool_put_page(), which handles page pool reference counting and recycling. There is no use of hwrm_req_init(), hwrm_req_replace(), or hwrm_req_drop() in this code path. The target bug pattern concerns leaking an HWRM request buffer by returning after a successful hwrm_req_init() without calling hwrm_req_drop(). Since the reported code does not involve any HWRM request initialization or cleanup, it cannot match the target pattern. The warning appears to be a misattribution caused by navigating through bnxt RX free paths that call page_pool APIs, but no HWRM request is initialized here. Therefore, this is a false positive and not a real bug of the specified type.
