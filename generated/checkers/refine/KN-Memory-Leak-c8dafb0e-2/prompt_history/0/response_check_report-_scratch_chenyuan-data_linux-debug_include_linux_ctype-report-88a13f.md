- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The report flags include/linux/ctype.h:45 (isdigit()), which has no relation to hwrm_req_init()/hwrm_req_drop() usage and cannot exhibit the target leak pattern. Examining the actual bnxt HWRM request sites shown:
  - bnxt_get_nvram_directory(), bnxt_get_nvram_item(), and bnxt_find_nvram_item() all call hwrm_req_drop() on every exit path after a successful hwrm_req_init(), including error paths (e.g., DMA slice allocation failure and after hwrm_req_send[_silent]()). Early returns only occur when hwrm_req_init() itself fails (rc != 0), in which case no drop is needed.
  - The flagged location in ctype.h is clearly unrelated and indicates a misattribution by the analyzer.

Therefore, the report does not match the target bug pattern and does not describe a real bug.
