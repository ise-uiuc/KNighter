- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning is attached to bnxt_vf_set_link() at the return on line 1130, but this function never calls hwrm_req_init(), so it cannot itself be missing a matching hwrm_req_drop(). The HWRM request allocations on the path from bnxt_vf_set_link() occur in its callees (bnxt_hwrm_exec_fwd_resp() and bnxt_hwrm_fwd_resp()), and any missing hwrm_req_drop() must be fixed in those helper functions, not here. The target bug pattern requires a successful hwrm_req_init() followed by an exit without hwrm_req_drop() from the same request lifetime; that is not present in bnxt_vf_set_link(). While the helpers appear to indeed lack hwrm_req_drop() (a separate issue), this specific report location does not match the target pattern and is therefore a false positive.
