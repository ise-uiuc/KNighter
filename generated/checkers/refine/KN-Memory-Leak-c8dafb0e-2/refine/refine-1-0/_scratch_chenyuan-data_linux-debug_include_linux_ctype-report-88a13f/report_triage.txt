- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning is misattributed and does not match the target bug pattern. The flagged location is include/linux/ctype.h:isdigit(), which is unrelated to bnxtâ€™s HWRM request handling and cannot involve hwrm_req_init()/hwrm_req_drop(). In the annotated bnxt functions that do use HWRM requests (bnxt_get_nvram_directory, bnxt_get_nvram_item, bnxt_find_nvram_item, and bnxt_ethtool_init), every successful hwrm_req_init() is followed by proper cleanup: error paths after allocation failures call hwrm_req_drop(), and normal completion paths also call hwrm_req_drop(). There is no exit after a successful hwrm_req_init() that omits hwrm_req_drop(). Therefore, the report does not exhibit the specified leak pattern and is a false positive.
