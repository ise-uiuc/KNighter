Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker uses fragile name matching (ExprHasName on OriginExpr) and tracks “acquired” requests globally without scoping them to the creating stack frame. As a result, it sometimes misses hwrm_req_drop() calls (macro/inline wrappers), keeps stale state across frames, and then reports at unrelated return statements (e.g., include/linux/ctype.h:isdigit).
- Fixes:
  1. Robust callee identification using CallEvent::getCalleeIdentifier() (with safe fallbacks), not source text.
  2. Track acquired req objects together with the creating stack frame (StackFrameContext) so we only report at returns/end of the same function that acquired the req.
  3. Clean up per-frame state when reporting and at function end to avoid leaks into callers and unrelated code.
  4. Keep the pending-return-symbol logic for successful hwrm_req_init() and maintain Clang-18 API compatibility.
- Edge cases:
  - Direct conditions on call result (if (hwrm_req_init(...))) and rc comparisons (rc, rc == 0, rc != 0) are handled.
  - Drop performed in callees or via wrappers/macros is detected via robust callee-name resolution.
  - Multiple reqs per function are supported.
- The checker still detects the target buggy code pattern where return after hwrm_req_replace(bp, req, ...) happens without calling hwrm_req_drop().
