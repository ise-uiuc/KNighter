Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports at any ReturnStmt when any resource is marked "acquired", regardless of the function where hwrm_req_init() happened. Because of inlining and analysis across functions, this caused a report inside unrelated inline helpers (e.g., page_pool helpers) while the obligation was created in a different function. Additionally, matching calls by source text is fragile.
- Fixes:
  1. Scope reporting to the stack frame that owns the req variable. Determine the owning StackFrameContext via VarRegion::getStackFrame() from the req MemRegion. Only report when returning from that exact frame (both at ReturnStmt and EndFunction).
  2. Improve call identification by using CallEvent::getCalleeIdentifier() instead of matching source text.
  3. Keep existing state tracking (PendingInitMap and AcquiredReqs) but filter leaks by owning frame to avoid false positives in unrelated functions/headers.
- Edge cases:
  - Multiple nested/inlined functions: only report when exiting the frame that owns the req variable.
  - Multiple reqs in a function: report if any remains in the owning frame.
  - Maintain detection of the target bug pattern (bnxt_send_msg missing drop on error path after hwrm_req_replace failure).
- Clang-18 API compatibility: Use stable APIs available in Clang-18; keep all existing includes unchanged.
