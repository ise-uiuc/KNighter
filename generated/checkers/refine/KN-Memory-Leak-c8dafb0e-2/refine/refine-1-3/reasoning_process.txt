Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports at any return statement in any inlined/callee function if there is any outstanding “acquired request” in the program state. This causes reports to be incorrectly emitted in unrelated functions (e.g., page_pool helpers) while analyzing code paths originating from bnxt functions. The checker does not scope the resource acquisition to the stack frame where hwrm_req_init() was successfully completed.
- Fixes:
  1. Track the stack frame (StackFrameContext) together with the req MemRegion when recording a successful hwrm_req_init(). This scopes the acquired resource to the function frame in which it was created.
  2. Only report at returns/end-of-function for the same stack frame where the acquisition happened. Do not report in other frames (e.g., inlined helper functions).
  3. Clean up per-frame owned entries at function end to avoid stale state propagating to callers.
  4. Improve callee-name detection using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() with a fallback to source text match, to ensure we detect hwrm_req_init, and release via hwrm_req_drop (and bnxt_req_drop alias).
  5. Preserve detection of the true positive pattern (bnxt_send_msg: missing drop on error path after successful hwrm_req_init and failed hwrm_req_replace).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Works when rc is checked in the typical style: if (rc) return rc; after hwrm_req_init.
  - Release in any callee is recognized; we remove the owned entry on hwrm_req_drop regardless of the frame.
  - We only warn on returns from the frame that performed the init, eliminating the spurious header/helper false positives.
  - We do not remove or change any includes. Code compiles with Clang-18 API.
