Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports at any ReturnStmt along the path, including returns inside inlined helper functions or headers, even when the HWRM request was acquired by a different function. This causes spurious reports in unrelated code (e.g., include/linux/bitmap.h).
- Fix approach:
  1. Track the owning function of each successfully-initialized request (MemRegion -> Owner Decl).
  2. Only report when exiting (returning from or ending) the same owning function, not from inlined callees.
  3. Keep using the existing pending map keyed by the return symbol of hwrm_req_init to determine success; augment it with another map to also remember the owner Decl.
  4. Robustify call matching using callee identifier, with fallback to text search for macro cases.
  5. Optionally avoid reporting for returns in system headers to further reduce noise.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Drops performed in helper functions: allowed, we remove the tracked region regardless of owner.
  - Implicit returns in void functions: handled via checkEndFunction; still filtered by owner.
  - Complex rc condition forms (rc, !rc, rc==0, rc!=0): supported via evalAssume.
- Compatibility: Uses stable Clang-18 APIs and common ProgramState traits.
