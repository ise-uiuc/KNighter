- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The report flags include/linux/bitmap.h:334 (bitmap_andnot) for a missing hwrm_req_drop(), but that function is a generic bitmap helper with no use of hwrm_req_init(), hwrm_req_send(), or any HWRM request objects. It cannot participate in the HWRM request lifecycle and thus cannot match the target bug pattern. Reviewing the nearby bnxt driver code that actually uses HWRM requests shows correct drop handling in functions like bnxt_update_link() and bnxt_hwrm_get_wol_fltrs(). While bnxt_fw_echo_reply() appears to miss an hwrm_req_drop() after hwrm_req_send(), the analyzer did not report that location. Therefore, the specific reported case does not match the target bug pattern and is a false positive.
