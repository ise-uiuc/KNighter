Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker currently treats any successful hwrm_req_init() as “acquiring a resource that must be dropped”, which is too aggressive. In the bnxt API usage, a drop is only required if the request is retained beyond a simple send path, i.e., after calling hwrm_req_hold() or hwrm_req_replace(). Helper functions that do init + send do not need a drop, causing the reported false positive.
- Fix: Track two states per req MemRegion:
  1) OpenInit: req was successfully initialized (rc == 0).
  2) NeedsDrop: req requires hwrm_req_drop() because hwrm_req_hold() or hwrm_req_replace() was invoked on an OpenInit req.
- Update logic:
  - On successful hwrm_req_init: mark req in OpenInitReqs.
  - On hwrm_req_hold: if req in OpenInitReqs, mark req in NeedsDropReqs.
  - On hwrm_req_replace: if req in OpenInitReqs, mark req in NeedsDropReqs (regardless of replace rc, matching the target bug where drop is required even on replace failure).
  - On hwrm_req_send: if req is OpenInit but not NeedsDrop, clear OpenInitReqs for that req (no drop required on pure init+send).
  - On hwrm_req_drop: clear both OpenInitReqs and NeedsDropReqs for that req.
  - Report only if NeedsDropReqs is non-empty at a return or end-of-function.
- This preserves detection of the real bug in bnxt_send_msg (replace failure path must drop), eliminates the false positive at bnxt_vf_set_link (init+send without hold/replace), and avoids regressions on other init+send helpers.
- Compatibility: Only uses Clang-18 API. No includes removed.
