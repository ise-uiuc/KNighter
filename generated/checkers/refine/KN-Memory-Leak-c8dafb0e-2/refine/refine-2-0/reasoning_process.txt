Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports at the end of any inlined function (e.g., isdigit in ctype.h) because it globally tracks “acquired” requests without scoping them to the owning stack frame. When the analyzer inlines helper functions, checkEndFunction/checkPreStmt fire inside those inlined frames and see the global set non-empty, producing false positives at unrelated locations.
- Fix: Scope ownership of each acquired request to the stack frame where hwrm_req_init succeeded. Only warn when returning from or finishing that same owning frame. Also clear frame-owned state on function exit to avoid state leaking into callers.
- Improve call matching: Use CallEvent::getCalleeIdentifier() (exact identifier match) instead of source-text substring matching to avoid spurious matches.
- State management updates:
  - Track pending init result with both the MemRegion and the current StackFrameContext.
  - On success branch, record owner frame of the acquired request.
  - On drop, remove ownership regardless of the frame where drop occurs.
  - On end-of-function, report only for requests owned by the current frame, then clear them.
  - Implement checkDeadSymbols to prune pending mappings whose return-value symbols die.
  - Optionally prune owner entries whose MemRegions are dead.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - Inlined functions: no warnings unless the request was acquired in that same inline frame.
  - Early returns: still warn if they occur in the owning frame and no drop happened.
  - Cleanup helpers: dropping in callees works (we remove by MemRegion).
  - Multiple inits on the same variable: last one wins; previous ownership is overwritten, drop still removes by MR.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang 18 APIs only. Keeps all includes as-is.
