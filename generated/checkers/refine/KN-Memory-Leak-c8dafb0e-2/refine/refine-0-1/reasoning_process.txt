Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker stores all acquired requests in a single global set (AcquiredReqs) without remembering which stack frame (function) acquired them. As a result, if an inlined callee leaks a request, the report can be emitted at the caller’s return statement, even though the caller did not call hwrm_req_init() — causing a false positive attribution.
- Fix:
  - Track the stack frame that successfully acquired the request. Record the StackFrameContext* of the frame in which hwrm_req_init() returned 0.
  - On hwrm_req_drop(), remove the corresponding acquired entry regardless of the current frame.
  - Only report at returns or end-of-function for the frame that actually acquired the request (i.e., where hwrm_req_init() succeeded). This ensures reports are attached to the helper function that leaked, not the caller.
  - Keep existing success-detection based on branching on the return code to maintain detection of true positives (e.g., bnxt_send_msg case).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - If cleanup occurs in a different helper, we still remove the acquired obligation on hwrm_req_drop() because we key removal by the req MemRegion* only.
  - If a callee leaks and is inlined, the report is emitted at the callee’s ReturnStmt or EndFunction, not at the caller’s ReturnStmt.
  - The checker continues to detect true positives in patterns like the bnxt_send_msg bug (if (rc) return rc; after replace) because hwrm_req_init() and the missing drop happen in the same function.
- API compatibility: Uses only Clang-18 stable APIs and existing includes.
