- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported location is in include/net/page_pool/helpers.h within page_pool_put_page(), which does not use the HWRM request API at all. The target bug pattern requires:
  - A successful hwrm_req_init(bp, req, ...) call, and
  - An error exit path that returns without calling hwrm_req_drop(bp, req).

  At the flagged line (page_pool_put_unrefed_page call), there is no preceding hwrm_req_init(), no HWRM request object, and no corresponding need to call hwrm_req_drop(). This code is generic page pool handling unrelated to BNXT HWRM requests. Therefore, the report does not match the specified bug pattern and is a false positive.

  Note: While other parts of the annotated file show BNXT driver code that does use hwrm_req_init()/hwrm_req_drop(), the warning specifically points to the page pool helper function, where the HWRM pattern is inapplicable.
