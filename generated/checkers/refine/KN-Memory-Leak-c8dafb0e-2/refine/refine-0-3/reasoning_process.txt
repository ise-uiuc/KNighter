Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker tracked “acquired” req variables globally and reported at any later return, regardless of the call stack frame that actually performed hwrm_req_init(). This allowed state to bleed across function frames and caused a report inside unrelated code (e.g., page_pool helpers), producing a false positive.
- Fixes:
  1. Scope acquisition to the function stack frame that performed the init by tracking AcquiredReqs as a map: req MemRegion* -> owning StackFrameContext*. Only report when returning from the same frame that owns the resource.
  2. Clean up per-frame acquisitions at the end of the function (checkEndFunction) to prevent state leakage into callers/callees and unrelated code.
  3. Use robust callee matching via CallEvent::getCalleeIdentifier() (instead of source-text substring search) to avoid accidental matches.
  4. Keep all existing includes and Clang-18 API compatibility. Add a small isFalsePositive helper that only reports when there is an acquisition in the current frame.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Multiple acquired reqs per function are tracked; we report if any is undropped at return, then clean up the frame’s entries.
  - hwrm_req_drop(bp, req) removes the corresponding entry for that req.
  - Successful init is recognized on the rc==0 branch via evalAssume; we only mark a req as acquired on the success path.
  - We do not report at returns inside inlined callees (e.g., page_pool_put_page) because their frames differ.
  - We avoid reporting for req-like objects not tied to a function-local stack frame by not attributing them to the current frame.
