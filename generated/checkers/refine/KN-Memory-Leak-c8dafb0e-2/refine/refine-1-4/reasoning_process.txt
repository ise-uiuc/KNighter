Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker tracks “acquired” requests globally and reports on any ReturnStmt, including returns in inlined/system headers (e.g. bitmap.h), rather than only at exits of the function that successfully acquired the request. This causes spurious reports far away from the real acquisition site.
- Fix:
  1) Make the state per-stack-frame: record the owning StackFrameContext of each successfully initialized request and keep a per-frame outstanding count. Only report when exiting the same frame (on return or end of function).
  2) Keep a PendingInitMap keyed by the symbolic return of hwrm_req_init() storing both the req MemRegion and the owner frame. Finalize to “acquired” on the success branch in evalAssume.
  3) On hwrm_req_drop(), find the owner of the req, accept drops from the same frame or any descendant frame in the current stack, and decrement the owner’s count.
  4) Clean up per-frame data in checkEndFunction to avoid stale state and suppress double reports by tracking frames already reported.
  5) Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() for name matching to avoid misidentification.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Multiple requests per function: handled via per-frame counts and per-req owner mapping.
  - Drop in helper/inline callees: treated as valid if the drop occurs in a descendant frame of the owner.
  - Pending init never checked: cleaned up on frame exit; no false positive reported.
  - Compatibility: The code uses only Clang-18 APIs and keeps existing includes. No includes are removed.
