Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports on any ReturnStmt while a request is “acquired” in the program state, regardless of which function owns the acquisition. With inlining, this triggers in unrelated helper functions (e.g., schedule_delayed_work in a header), causing false positives.
- Fix approach:
  1. Scope acquisitions to the owning stack frame (StackFrameContext) of the function that successfully called hwrm_req_init().
  2. Only warn when exiting the owner function (at its ReturnStmt or at EndFunction).
  3. Purge all acquisitions owned by a function when that function ends, to avoid leaking state to callers.
  4. Avoid duplicate reporting by tracking frames already reported.
- Edge cases and regressions considered:
  - Nested/inlined calls: no warnings unless returning from the owner function.
  - Cleanups via labels and regular drop calls anywhere on the path are respected.
  - Multiple acquisitions per function are supported.
  - State is purged on function exit to prevent follow-up false reports.
- Maintain detection: The checker still flags the bnxt_send_msg case where a return after hwrm_req_replace follows a successful hwrm_req_init without a drop.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 API patterns and existing includes. No includes removed.
