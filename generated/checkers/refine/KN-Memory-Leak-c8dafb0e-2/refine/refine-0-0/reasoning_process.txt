Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports on any ReturnStmt, including returns from inlined helper functions (e.g., isdigit in ctype.h). Since AcquiredReqs were tracked globally without function-scope ownership, the checker falsely flagged returns inside unrelated inlined functions before the owning function had a chance to clean up with hwrm_req_drop().
- Fix strategy:
  1. Scope the leak check to the function that owns the req variable by filtering AcquiredReqs entries based on the enclosing FunctionDecl of the tracked req variable's VarRegion/ParmVarRegion. Only report on returns that exit the same function in which hwrm_req_init succeeded.
  2. Remove acquired entries for the current function when leaving it (on return or end-of-function) to avoid propagation and duplicate reports.
  3. Improve robustness of success-path tracking:
     - Keep pending mapping keyed by the return symbol of hwrm_req_init().
     - Add a pending mapping keyed by the destination variable region when the return value is assigned to a variable (rc). This avoids missing the success branch when later checking rc.
     - Enhance evalAssume to recognize SymbolRegionValue symbols (i.e., rc) and SymIntExpr comparisons (rc == 0, rc != 0), using both pending maps.
  4. Improve call detection by using Call.getCalleeIdentifier() if available, with a source-text fallback.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Multiple req variables in a function: handled, tracked individually by MemRegion base.
  - Drop in another helper function: handled; we remove tracking on drop regardless of current function; only reporting is gated by owner function.
  - No explicit return (fallthrough): covered by checkEndFunction.
  - Assignment vs direct use of return value: handled via PendingInitMap (return symbol) and PendingInitByVar (destination rc region).
- Clang-18 compatibility: Uses stable APIs (MemRegion/VarRegion/ParmVarDecl, SymbolRegionValue, check::Bind, check::EndFunction). Keeps all includes unchanged.
