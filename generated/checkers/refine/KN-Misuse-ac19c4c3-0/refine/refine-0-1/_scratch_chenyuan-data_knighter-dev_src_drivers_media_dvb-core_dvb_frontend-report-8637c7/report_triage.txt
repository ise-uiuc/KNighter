- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged multiplication occurs in copy_to_user with tvps->num coming from userspace. However, tvps->num is bounded by an explicit check to 1..DTV_IOCTL_MAX_MSGS before use. DTV_IOCTL_MAX_MSGS is a small constant (64), so the product tvps->num * sizeof(struct compat_dtv_property) is tightly bounded and cannot overflow size_t on any supported architecture. Additionally, the earlier memdup_array_user() call already uses an overflow-checked allocation for the same array. While using array_size() would be stylistically preferable, overflow is not feasible here, so this does not match the target bug pattern.
