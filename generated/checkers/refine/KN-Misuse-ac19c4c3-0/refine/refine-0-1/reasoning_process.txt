Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports when it cannot prove the multiplication fits in size_t. In the false-positive case, the count is range-checked earlier (tvps->num in [1..DTV_IOCTL_MAX_MSGS]), but our checker failed to recover this upper bound from the path constraints, so it considered the count “unbounded” and emitted a warning.
- Fix:
  - Add lightweight, path-sensitive upper-bound tracking for symbols via a ProgramState map. Update the map during evalAssume by decoding relational symbolic conditions (including the taken/untaken branch) and recording a non-strict upper bound when implied.
  - Consult this map (in addition to the constraint manager and constant evaluation) when computing the maximum count for overflow proof. Use the tightest upper bound when multiple sources exist.
  - Keep current safety proof logic: suppress only when the product is provably within size_t, otherwise report if the count is tainted or we lack a constraint-derived bound.
- Edge cases handled:
  - Casts on the symbol are canonicalized when storing/looking-up upper bounds.
  - Handle IntSymExpr and SymIntExpr RHS/LHS variants for <, <=, >, >= with true/false assumptions.
  - Short-circuited conditions are decomposed by the engine; our evalAssume handler will see the relational components and record bounds along the explored path.
- Regression precautions:
  - We do not suppress unless the product is provably safe, so true positives remain detectable, including the bcachefs target code (no prior bound => still warned).
- Compatibility:
  - Uses existing Clang 18 APIs and ProgramStateTrait map.
  - No includes removed.
