Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker blindly warns on sizeof(T) * count in copy_to/from_user without recognizing common safe kernel idioms. In the FP, the buffer is a flexible-array-member (FAM) inside a kernel struct, and the count is the sibling length field from the same object. Even if the count type is wider (e.g., u32 on 32-bit), the actual usage pattern is safe and already bounded through struct_size at allocation time. Our checker lacks a suppression for this FAM-count idiom and cannot leverage cross-function constraints.
- Fixes:
  1. Keep existing bound reasoning and path constraints.
  2. Add a precise suppression for the Linux FAM idiom:
     - If the kernel buffer argument of copy_to_user/copy_from_user is a flexible array member S->arr[], and the size is sizeof(elem) * S->count, where count is a field from the same S object, and the element type matches sizeof(elem), then suppress unless count is tainted.
  3. Keep type-max fallback and taint checks, and maintain the current detection of the target bcachefs bug.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We only suppress when:
    - The kernel buffer really comes from a FAM (FieldDecl::isFlexibleArrayMember()) and sizeof(elem) matches the FAM element type size, and
    - The count field is taken from the same base object as the FAM, and
    - The count is not tainted.
  - This avoids suppressing the bcachefs bug (copy_from_user into kcalloc'ed pointer; not a FAM, and count comes from user).
  - Maintain compatibility with Clang-18 API, using FieldDecl::isFlexibleArrayMember, IncompleteArrayType, getTypeSizeInChars, ProgramState taint, and existing utilities.
- Implementation:
  - Extend isTargetFunction to return both the size argument index and the kernel buffer index (for copy_to_user, from arg; for copy_from_user, to arg).
  - Add a helper that detects the FAM-count pattern and returns true when itâ€™s safe to suppress.
  - Query taint on the count expression and avoid suppression if tainted.
  - Keep the existing map-based constraint tracking and type-width suppression.
