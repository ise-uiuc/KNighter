- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warned site is in aio_read_events_ring(): copy_to_user(event + ret, ev + pos, sizeof(*ev) * avail). Although this is an open-coded sizeof(*ev) * count, the “count” (avail) is not an unbounded userspace-controlled value. Its bounds are tightly constrained by kernel state:
  - avail is first computed from ring internals as the number of available events (bounded by ctx->nr_events).
  - It is then further capped by min(avail, nr - ret), and crucially by min_t(long, avail, AIO_EVENTS_PER_PAGE - pos).
  - AIO_EVENTS_PER_PAGE = PAGE_SIZE / sizeof(struct io_event), and pos < AIO_EVENTS_PER_PAGE, so the final avail is ≤ AIO_EVENTS_PER_PAGE. Therefore the multiplication sizeof(*ev) * avail is ≤ PAGE_SIZE, i.e., at most one page, on all architectures.
  - On 32-bit, overflow would require avail > ~134 million for sizeof(*ev)=32, which is impossible given the above cap (≤ 256 or 128 typically). On 64-bit, overflow is even less feasible.

This does not match the target bug pattern, which requires a size multiplication derived from userspace without proper overflow checking. Here the copy size is kernel-bounded and cannot overflow size_t. Thus the report is a false positive.
