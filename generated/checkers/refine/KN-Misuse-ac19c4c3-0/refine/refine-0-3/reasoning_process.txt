Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any sizeof(x) * count pattern in size arguments of copy_{to,from}_user regardless of whether count can be influenced by userspace. In the false positive (fs/aio.c), the count (avail) is kernel-bounded by ring/page constraints and is not userspace-tainted. Our current checker lacks dedicated tainting for copy_from_user destinations and therefore cannot reliably tell when a later field like arg.nr_devs originates from userspace. It also relies on path constraints and simple bounds but doesn't understand kernel min-like clamping macros.
- Fix strategy:
  1) Add taint source for copy_from_user’s destination buffer in checkPostCall so that subsequent loads from that struct (e.g., arg.nr_devs) are recognized as tainted.
  2) Gate reporting to cases where the count expression is tainted by userspace, unless the product is provably safe. This suppresses kernel-internal patterns like the AIO ring-buffer copy_to_user while still detecting the actual bug where count is from userspace.
  3) Keep the existing upper-bound reasoning and program-state map (SymbolUpperBoundMap) to avoid missing safe cases even if tainted (e.g., min(n, K) with product provably ≤ SIZE_MAX).
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The checker now focuses on the stated bug pattern (userspace-derived count), reducing false positives in kernel-internal bounded loops.
  - It still detects the bcachefs bug: arg.nr_devs becomes tainted via the preceding copy_from_user(&arg, ...), and the open-coded multiplication remains non-provably safe, so it is reported.
  - We maintain compatibility with Clang-18 API and do not remove any includes.
  - The path-sensitive bound tracking via evalAssume remains in place.
