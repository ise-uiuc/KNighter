Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker unconditionally warns whenever it sees sizeof(x) * Count passed as the size argument to copy_from_user/copy_to_user when Count is non-constant. It ignores path constraints that cap Count to small values and ignores type ranges, resulting in false positives like the DA7280 case where custom_len is validated to be small before the copy.
- Fix approach:
  - Compute the element size from sizeof operand.
  - Infer an upper bound on Count:
    - Prefer the path-sensitive bound returned by the ConstraintManager (inferSymbolMaxVal).
    - If no constraint bound is available, fall back to the Count’s integer type maximum.
  - Prove safety: If Count_max <= floor(SIZE_MAX / elem_size), the multiplication cannot overflow size_t and we should not warn.
  - Only report if not provably safe and:
    - Count is tainted by user input, or
    - There is no constraint-derived bound (i.e., we couldn’t prove any tightened upper bound beyond the raw type).
  - Keep ignoring patterns already using array_size/struct_size.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Count is compile-time constant: skip.
  - Count has a small integer type (e.g., u16) making overflow impossible: skip.
  - Count constrained by prior checks (e.g., <= small constant): skip via ConstraintManager.
  - Tainted unknown Count without constraints: warn (ensures detection of target buggy code).
- Compatibility: Uses only Clang-18 APIs already included; no includes removed; relies on provided helper functions; no new program state traits required.
