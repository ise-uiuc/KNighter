- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: Although the code uses an open-coded multiplication (sizeof(*bos) * args->nr_bos) for copy_from_user, the user-controlled counts are tightly bounded before use:
  - args->nr_bos <= SZ_128K (131072)
  - args->nr_relocs <= SZ_128K
  - args->nr_pmrs <= 128
  These limits ensure the products cannot overflow size_t on either 32-bit or 64-bit systems. For example, even with a generous element size of 64 bytes, 131072 * 64 = 8 MiB, far below 4 GiB (32-bit size_t max) and trivial for 64-bit. Additionally, allocations use kvmalloc_array(count, size), which is overflow-safe, so allocation and copy sizes remain consistent. Therefore, there is no realistic overflow risk here, and this does not match the target bug pattern of an unbounded, overflow-prone size calculation from userspace.
