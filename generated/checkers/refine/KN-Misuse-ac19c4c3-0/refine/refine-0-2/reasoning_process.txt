Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports even when the user-controlled count is tightly bounded on the current path (e.g., under guards like if (a > K || b > K2 || c > K3) return -EINVAL;). It fails to learn small path-sensitive upper bounds from disjunctive conditions, so it cannot prove the product fits into size_t and emits a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1. Teach evalAssume to decompose logical disjunctions/conjunctions (BO_LOr/BO_LAnd) and record implied comparisons when the respective assumption is known (e.g., (A || B) assumed false => both A and B are false). This allows us to extract bounds like n <= K from guards such as (n > K) inside OR-chains.
  2. Store learned S <= C bounds in a ProgramState map (already present) and consult it later in checkPreCall to prove product safety.
  3. Simplify reporting logic: report whenever the product is not provably safe; suppress only when we can prove it fits in size_t. This keeps true-positive detection (e.g., bcachefs case) and eliminates the FP (etnaviv case), where small upper bounds like SZ_128K make overflow impossible.
- Edge cases:
  - Handle both SymIntExpr and IntSymExpr comparators; ignore SymSymExpr unless a constant bound can be derived.
  - Carefully process LOr/LAnd: only propagate definite knowledge (false over OR; true over AND). Avoid introducing spurious constraints.
  - Maintain Clang-18 compatibility and keep all includes.
- Regression considerations:
  - We do not suppress based on allocation helpers like kvmalloc_array, so weâ€™ll still flag the bcachefs pattern where copy_from_user uses open-coded sizeof(x) * count without proven bounds.
  - We avoid suppressing when product may still overflow even if a bound exists but is large; such cases remain reported.
