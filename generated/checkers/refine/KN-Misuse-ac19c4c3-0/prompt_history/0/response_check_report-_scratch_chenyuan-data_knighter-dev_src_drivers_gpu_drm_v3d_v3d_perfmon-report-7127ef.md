- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged multiplication occurs in copy_to_user with size perfmon->ncounters * sizeof(u64). Although perfmon->ncounters originates from userspace via the create ioctl, it is tightly bounded and validated in this driver:

  - The driver allocates the perfmon object using struct_size(perfmon, values, req->ncounters), which uses overflow-checked helpers. Any attempt to pass an excessively large ncounters would cause the allocation to fail rather than succeed with a wrapped size.
  - The code elsewhere treats ncounters as small (assigned to a u8 and used to build a bitmask), implying a hard upper bound by hardware (typically <= 32). Thus ncounters * 8 is at most a few hundred bytes, far below any size_t limits on 32/64-bit.
  - The values buffer being copied out is sized exactly to ncounters elements from the same validated count, so even in the worst case there is no kernel OOB; at most an undersized copy could occur if overflow happened (which it cannot given the bounds above).

This does not match the target bug pattern, which requires an unbounded user-controlled count leading to a possible size_t overflow in the size calculation. Here the count is bounded and previously overflow-checked via struct_size, so the reported instance is a false positive. Using array_size() would be stylistically fine but does not fix a real bug.
