- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported dereference at line 58 (chip->mem->phys/virt) is not the result of a devm_kzalloc() allocation. In this driver:
  - chip itself is allocated with devm_kzalloc() and immediately checked: if (!chip) return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).
  - chip->pins and chip->regs are allocated with devm_kcalloc() and each is checked for NULL before use.
  - chip->mem is not allocated via devm_kzalloc(); it is assigned to &pfc->windows[i], where i is validated to be a valid index into pfc->windows (the code searches for a matching window and if not found, returns early). Thus chip->mem cannot be NULL in the execution path that uses it.

This does not match the target bug pattern (immediate dereference of a devm_kzalloc() result without NULL check), and there is no feasible NULL dereference due to allocation failure here.
