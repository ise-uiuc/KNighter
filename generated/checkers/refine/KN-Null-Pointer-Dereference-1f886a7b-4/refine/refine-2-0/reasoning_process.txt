Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fails to recognize kernel macro wrappers around NULL checks (e.g., unlikely/likely via __builtin_expect). As a result, the pointer returned by devm_kzalloc() remains marked “unchecked” even after it was checked with if (unlikely(!ptr)), so later harmless dereferences (like rtc->rtc_dev) still trigger a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  - Robustly unwrap boolean wrappers in branch conditions: strip __builtin_expect(likely/unlikely), parentheses, implicit casts, and chains of logical not (!!) to find the underlying pointer being null-checked.
  - Improve branch-condition logic to correctly remove symbols from the “unchecked” set when they are tested for nullness even when wrapped (e.g., unlikely(!ptr), __builtin_expect(!!ptr, …), etc.).
  - Use callee identifier matching for devm_kzalloc rather than stringifying the source to avoid noise.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Handles if (ptr), if (!ptr), if (ptr == NULL), if (ptr != NULL), including when wrapped by likely/unlikely/__builtin_expect and with chains of logical-not (!!).
  - Keeps current behavior of removing the unchecked mark when a nullness check is encountered. This mirrors the existing checker’s behavior (pre-existing limitation: it doesn’t track which branch is taken; changing to path-sensitive removal would require evalAssume and is out of scope for this targeted fix).
- Compatibility:
  - Keeps Clang-18 API usage.
  - Does not remove any include; only adds helper functions and uses existing APIs.
