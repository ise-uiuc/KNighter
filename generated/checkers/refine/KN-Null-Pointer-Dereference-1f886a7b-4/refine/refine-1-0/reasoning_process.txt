Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker tracks the devm_kzalloc() return symbol but does not consult the analyzer’s constraint manager at dereference time, nor does it properly understand kernel wrappers like unlikely()/__builtin_expect(). As a result, even after a successful null-check (if (unlikely(!ptr)) return ...), the symbol remains in the Unchecked set and triggers a false positive when the pointer is used later (e.g., rtc->rtc_dev).
- Fixes:
  1) Only track true devm_kzalloc calls via CallEvent callee identifier (avoid text-based matching).
  2) At dereference (checkLocation), query the constraint manager and warn only if the symbol is not definitely non-null. This leverages the core engine’s path constraints and eliminates FPs when the pointer has been proven non-null (e.g., after if (unlikely(!ptr)) return ...).
  3) Keep state tracking of devm_kzalloc symbols but stop aggressively removing symbols in checkBranchCondition to avoid regressions when pointers are conditionally checked in a branch but dereferenced unguardedly elsewhere.
- Edge cases:
  - Double-negation or macro-wrapped checks (likely/unlikely/__builtin_expect) will be handled implicitly by constraint checks at dereference time.
  - No regression for the target buggy pattern (un-checked dereference after devm_kzalloc), because in that case the pointer is not constrained non-null and will still be reported.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Use SValBuilder and ProgramStateRef::assume to query non-null constraints; rely only on stable APIs.
