- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported path does not match the target bug pattern and is not a real bug. In ftm_rtc_probe():
  - The per-instance struct allocated with devm_kzalloc (rtc) is immediately checked for NULL and returns -ENOMEM if allocation fails. So there is no unchecked dereference of the devm_kzalloc result.
  - The pointer later dereferenced (rtc->rtc_dev->ops) comes from devm_rtc_allocate_device(), not directly from devm_kzalloc(). devm_rtc_allocate_device() uses the ERR_PTR convention on failure (returns ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM), etc.) and does not return NULL. The code correctly checks IS_ERR(rtc->rtc_dev) and returns on error, ensuring rtc->rtc_dev is a valid non-ERR, non-NULL pointer before it is dereferenced.
  - Therefore, a NULL pointer dereference is not feasible here, and the case does not exhibit the specified pattern of dereferencing a devm_kzalloc result without a NULL check.
