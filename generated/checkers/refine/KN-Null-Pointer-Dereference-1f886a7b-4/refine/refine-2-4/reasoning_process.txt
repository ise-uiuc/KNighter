Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only recognizes direct branch conditions like if (!ptr) and misses null-checks wrapped inside macros or wrapper calls such as if (WARN_ON(!ptr)). In the false positive, the allocation was checked via WARN_ON(!clk_hw_data) but the checker didn’t recognize this and kept the symbol marked “unchecked,” later flagging a dereference.
- Fixes:
  1. Enhance branch-condition handling to find null-checks inside wrapper call expressions (e.g., WARN_ON, unlikely) by recursively analyzing call arguments and extracting null-checked symbols. Only recognize explicit null-check patterns in call arguments (like !ptr, ptr == NULL) to avoid over-clearing in arbitrary function calls.
  2. Use Call.getCalleeIdentifier() to precisely match devm_kzalloc instead of source-text matching, reducing spurious tracking.
- Edge cases/regressions: The recursive condition analysis restricts “inside-call” acceptance to explicit null-check patterns, avoiding clearing for generic calls that simply pass the pointer. Top-level if (ptr) still clears (as before). This prevents regressions while fixing the WARN_ON(!ptr) case. No API changes beyond Clang-18. No includes removed.
- Detection of true positives is preserved: The target buggy code still lacks a check for spi_bus->spi_int[iter]; the checker continues to track the devm_kzalloc return and will report when spi_sub_ptr->spi_host is assigned via dereference.
