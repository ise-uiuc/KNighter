Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fails to recognize null checks that are wrapped by macros like unlikely()/likely(), which expand to __builtin_expect. As a result, the symbol from devm_kzalloc() remains in the UncheckedDevmPtrSyms set and any later dereference (even when properly checked) is reported, causing the false positive in drivers/pinctrl/renesas/gpio.c.
- Fix approach:
  1) Enhance branch condition handling to unwrap boolean wrappers (notably __builtin_expect) and then detect the underlying null-check patterns: !ptr, ptr == NULL, ptr != NULL, ptr.
  2) Before reporting, double-check with the constraint manager that the pointer cannot be null at the dereference point (path-sensitive filter). If the state proves non-null, do not report.
- Edge cases and regressions: The unwrap logic is conservative (only removes wrappers for __builtin_expect), which is common in Linux. The path-sensitive “non-null” proof avoids reporting when a null check occurred in the same path even if our ad-hoc set missed it. This maintains detection of true positives like the PCI1xxxx SPI patch, where there is no null-check for the devm_kzalloc result.
- Compatibility: The solution uses Clang-18 APIs (SValBuilder::evalEQ, makeSymbolVal, assume) and preserves all existing includes and checker registration.
