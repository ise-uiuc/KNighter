Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only recognizes direct null checks like if (!ptr) or if (ptr == NULL) at the top level of the condition. It misses checks hidden inside wrappers/macros (e.g., if (WARN_ON(!ptr))) because the top-level AST node is a CallExpr/StmtExpr and the checker doesn't recurse into it. As a result, the tracked symbol is never marked as checked and later dereferences are incorrectly reported. Additionally, the checker reports without consulting path constraints, so it warns even when the pointer is provably non-NULL along the current path.
- Fixes:
  1) Make devm_kzalloc detection robust by using the callee identifier instead of source-text matching.
  2) Suppress false positives at dereference time by querying the constraint manager: only report if the pointer can be NULL along the current path; if it is provably non-NULL, drop it from the tracking set.
  3) Optionally, improve condition handling for performance by recursively analyzing branch conditions to remove symbols when a NULL check is present inside wrappers. To avoid regressions (which would suppress true positives in code that checks but doesnâ€™t guard), we do not remove on generic truthiness checks (if (p)), only on explicit null checks (!p, p == NULL, p != NULL) possibly nested inside call/wrapper or logical operators.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Wrapper macros like WARN_ON(!p), likely/unlikely wrappers, and GNU statement expressions.
  - Non-guarded checks (e.g., if (p) { ... } then dereference unconditionally later) remain detectable because we only suppress at dereference if the pointer is provably non-NULL on that path.
  - The target buggy code spi_sub_ptr->... after devm_kzalloc without check is still detected because no constraints force non-NULL and dereference is direct on the tracked symbol.
- Maintain Clang-18 compatibility and keep existing includes.
