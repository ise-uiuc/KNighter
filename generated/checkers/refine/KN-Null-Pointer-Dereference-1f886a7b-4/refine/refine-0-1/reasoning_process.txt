Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fails to recognize that a NULL-check has been performed when the condition is wrapped in builtins/macros like unlikely/likely (which lower to __builtin_expect). As a result, symbols returned by devm_kzalloc() are not removed from the “unchecked” set, and later dereferences (even after a proper check) are falsely reported. In the reported FP, chip is allocated with devm_kzalloc and checked with if (unlikely(!chip)), but the checker didn’t strip the wrapper to see the actual !chip check.
- Fix:
  - Add robust extraction of the pointer symbol from branch conditions:
    - Strip wrappers such as __builtin_expect and __builtin_expect_with_probability.
    - Support logical compositions (&&, ||) recursively.
    - Recognize direct pointer truthiness checks (if (ptr)), negations (if (!ptr)), and explicit comparisons (ptr == NULL, ptr != NULL).
  - Keep existing behavior for dereference detection, but ensure we only report if the symbol is still in the unchecked set.
- Edge cases considered:
  - if (unlikely(!ptr)) and if (likely(ptr)) will be handled.
  - if (!ptr || ...) and if (ptr && ...) patterns will be recognized.
  - IS_ERR_OR_NULL(ptr) often expands to an expression containing !ptr and will be recognized through the logical operators.
- Regressions:
  - We avoid being overly aggressive by only removing symbols when the condition semantically tests pointer truthiness or nullness (directly, with negation, via EQ/NE NULL, inside LAnd/LOr, and through __builtin_expect wrappers). We do not remove on arbitrary pointer arithmetic or unrelated comparisons.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs (FunctionDecl::getBuiltinID, Builtin::ID). No includes were removed.
