Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only clears the “unchecked devm_kzalloc result” state when it sees simple, top-level if-conditions involving the pointer (ptr, !ptr, ptr == NULL, ptr != NULL). Linux commonly uses wrapper macros like WARN_ON(!ptr), WARN_ON_ONCE(!ptr), likely(ptr), unlikely(!ptr), and IS_ERR_OR_NULL(ptr) inside branch conditions. Because the current checker doesn’t recursively inspect the AST of the branch condition or unwrap these wrappers, it fails to recognize that a proper NULL-check took place. As a result, the tracked symbol remains “unchecked” and a later store/load through the allocated object is misinterpreted as a dereference without a preceding check, yielding a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1. Add a robust extractor that recursively scans the branch condition’s AST to find symbols that are NULL-checked anywhere within the condition, including inside typical Linux wrappers/macros.
  2. Specifically recognize patterns:
     - ptr == NULL / ptr != NULL
     - !ptr
     - likely(ptr) / unlikely(ptr) treat as a truthiness NULL-check for the first argument
     - IS_ERR_OR_NULL(ptr) treat as a valid NULL-check
     - WARN_ON/BUG_ON: recursively analyze their first argument so that WARN_ON(!ptr) is recognized, but do not treat WARN_ON(ptr) alone as a NULL-check
  3. When any such check is found, remove the corresponding symbol(s) from the UncheckedDevmPtrSyms set in checkBranchCondition.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Do not treat arbitrary CallExpr arguments as checks to avoid suppressing true positives where a pointer is used as an argument in a condition without actually being NULL-checked.
  - Only treat the recognized wrappers above as special.
  - Continue reporting on both loads and stores that dereference the tracked pointer (through arrow/array/field access), preserving detection for the target buggy code that dereferences the result of devm_kzalloc without any check.
- Compatibility: The changes use Clang Static Analyzer APIs available in Clang-18 and maintain all existing includes.
