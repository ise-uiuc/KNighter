Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only removes a devm_kzalloc-return symbol from the “unchecked” set when the branch condition is a direct null-check expression (e.g., if (!ptr), if (ptr == NULL)). Kernel code often wraps the condition in likely/unlikely, which expand to __builtin_expect(!!(expr), ...), and can introduce double-negation. The checker fails to recognize the wrapped/check pattern; therefore, the symbol remains tracked and yields a false positive on later dereference (as in if (IS_ERR(rtc->rtc_dev)) using rtc->..., after the earlier if (unlikely(!rtc)) check).
- Fix strategy:
  1. Strengthen branch-condition analysis to correctly unwrap wrapper constructs:
     - Specifically detect __builtin_expect(...) and analyze its first argument.
     - Peel off arbitrary numbers of logical nots “!” introduced by “!!” from likely/unlikely.
     - Then detect ptr checks (ptr, !ptr, ptr == NULL, ptr != NULL) and remove the matching symbol from the Unchecked set.
  2. Tighten post-call tracking to match the callee identifier exactly (“devm_kzalloc”) instead of searching the expression’s source text. This reduces accidental tracking of unrelated calls and improves robustness.
- Edge cases:
  - Expressions like if (unlikely(ptr)) and if (unlikely(!ptr)) are now handled.
  - Nested casts and parens are ignored (we strip them).
  - We continue not to over-generalize: we only specially unwrap __builtin_expect. We do not remove the tracked symbol for arbitrary calls like if (foo(ptr)), which avoids regressions where no null-check actually occurs.
- Regression safety:
  - We retain the existing null-check patterns (direct !ptr, ptr == NULL, ptr != NULL, ptr).
  - We do not change dereference detection (MemberExpr “->”, “*p”).
  - The checker still flags the target buggy code pattern (missing check after devm_kzalloc with immediate deref), including cases where the pointer is stored in an array then used via a temporary.
- Clang-18 compatibility:
  - Uses public APIs already present in Clang-18.
  - No removal of includes; only internal logic changes and helper routines.
