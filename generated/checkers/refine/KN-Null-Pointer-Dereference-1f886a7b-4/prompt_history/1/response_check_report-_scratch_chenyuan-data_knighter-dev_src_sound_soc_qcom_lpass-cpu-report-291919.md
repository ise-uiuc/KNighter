- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The code allocates drvdata->i2sctl with devm_kzalloc() in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe() and immediately passes it to lpass_cpu_init_i2sctl_bitfields(), where it is dereferenced (e.g., i2sctl->loopback = ...). There is no NULL check after the allocation. devm_kzalloc() returns NULL on allocation failure, so this can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This matches the target bug pattern exactly: a per-instance structure is allocated with devm_kzalloc() and then dereferenced without checking for NULL. A proper fix would be to check drvdata->i2sctl for NULL and return -ENOMEM before calling lpass_cpu_init_i2sctl_bitfields().
