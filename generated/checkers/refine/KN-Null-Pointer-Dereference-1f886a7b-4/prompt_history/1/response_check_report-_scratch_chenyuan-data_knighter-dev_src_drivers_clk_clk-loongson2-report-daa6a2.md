- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported line (hws[LOONGSON2_GMAC_CLK] = devm_clk_hw_register_divider(...)) does not call devm_kzalloc() directly nor dereference its result. devm_clk_hw_register_divider() internally allocates and returns a struct clk_hw pointer with ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM) on failure (not NULL), consistent with the clk frameworkâ€™s conventions. The code later validates these returns via IS_ERR() in loongson2_check_clk_hws(), which is the correct error-handling pattern. The only direct devm_kzalloc() uses in this file (allocating hw in loongson2_clk_register and clk_hw_onecell_data in loongson2_clk_probe) are immediately checked for NULL before dereference. Therefore, this does not match the target bug pattern (immediate dereference of unchecked devm_kzalloc() return) and is not a real NULL-deref bug.
