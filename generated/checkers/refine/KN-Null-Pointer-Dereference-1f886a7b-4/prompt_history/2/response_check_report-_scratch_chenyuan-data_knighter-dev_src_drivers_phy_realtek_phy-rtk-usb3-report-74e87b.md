- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The code allocates rtk_phy->phy_cfg with devm_kzalloc() in rtk_usb3phy_probe() and immediately dereferences it via memcpy() without checking for NULL:
  - rtk_phy->phy_cfg = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*phy_cfg), GFP_KERNEL);
  - memcpy(rtk_phy->phy_cfg, phy_cfg, sizeof(*phy_cfg));
  If devm_kzalloc() fails, memcpy() will dereference a NULL pointer. This exactly matches the target bug pattern: allocation with devm_kzalloc() followed by immediate use without a NULL check. Downstream code (e.g., get_phy_data_by_efuse() dereferencing phy_cfg->check_efuse at line 440) would also crash if the allocation failed, reinforcing the same root cause. In contrast, the driver correctly checks the devm_kzalloc() result for rtk_phy->phy_parameter in parse_phy_data(), highlighting the missing check for phy_cfg. A proper fix would add:
  - if (!rtk_phy->phy_cfg) return -ENOMEM;
  immediately after the allocation, which is consistent with how this bug pattern is typically addressed.
