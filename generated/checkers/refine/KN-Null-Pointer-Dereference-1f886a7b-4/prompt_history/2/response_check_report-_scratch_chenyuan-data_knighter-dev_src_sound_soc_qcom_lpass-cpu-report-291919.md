- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The code allocates drvdata->i2sctl with devm_kzalloc() in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe() and immediately passes it to lpass_cpu_init_i2sctl_bitfields(), where it is dereferenced (i2sctl->loopback, etc.) without any NULL check. devm_kzalloc() returns NULL on allocation failure (GFP_KERNEL), and there is no guarding check between the allocation and the dereference. This exactly matches the target bug pattern: a per-instance structure allocated with devm_kzalloc() and dereferenced without checking for NULL, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference on OOM. Other resources in the function are properly checked (e.g., IS_ERR checks for regmap fields), reinforcing that the missing NULL check here is an oversight. A proper fix would add if (!drvdata->i2sctl) return -ENOMEM; after the allocation or handle NULL inside lpass_cpu_init_i2sctl_bitfields().
