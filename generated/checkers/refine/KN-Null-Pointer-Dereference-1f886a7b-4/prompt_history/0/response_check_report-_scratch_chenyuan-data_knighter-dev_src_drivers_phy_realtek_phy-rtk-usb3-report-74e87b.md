- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The code in rtk_usb3phy_probe() allocates rtk_phy->phy_cfg with devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*phy_cfg), GFP_KERNEL) and immediately uses it as the destination of memcpy(rtk_phy->phy_cfg, phy_cfg, sizeof(*phy_cfg)) without checking for NULL. If devm_kzalloc() fails, memcpy() dereferences a NULL pointer, causing a crash. This matches the target bug pattern: a per-instance structure allocated via devm_kzalloc() is dereferenced without a NULL check. The size argument to memcpy is sizeof(*phy_cfg), which is non-zero, so a NULL destination is invalid. A correct fix would be to add a NULL check (e.g., if (!rtk_phy->phy_cfg) return -ENOMEM;) before the memcpy.
