- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The flagged dereference at line 58 uses chip->mem, not the direct result of a devm_kzalloc() call. In this code path:
  - The only devm_kzalloc() here is for struct sh_pfc_chip in sh_pfc_add_gpiochip(), and it is correctly checked:
    - chip = devm_kzalloc(...); if (!chip) return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
  - chip->mem is then assigned from the mem parameter: chip->mem = mem;, where mem is passed as &pfc->windows[i] from sh_pfc_register_gpiochip(). The code ensures i is a valid index into pfc->windows by searching for the window containing the GPIO register address and returning early if no such window is found. Thus chip->mem is not NULL on this path.
  - Other dynamic allocations in this file (chip->regs via devm_kcalloc and chip->pins via devm_kcalloc) are both checked for NULL before use.
  - Therefore, there is no instance of dereferencing the result of devm_kzalloc()/devm_kcalloc() without a NULL check, and the reported site does not match the specified target bug pattern.
