- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The code allocates drvdata->i2sctl with devm_kzalloc() in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe() and immediately uses it by passing to lpass_cpu_init_i2sctl_bitfields() without checking for NULL. Inside lpass_cpu_init_i2sctl_bitfields(), the pointer is dereferenced (i2sctl->loopback, etc.) with no NULL guard. devm_kzalloc() can return NULL on allocation failure (GFP_KERNEL), so this can lead to a NULL pointer dereference during probe. This matches the target bug pattern exactly (allocation with devm_kzalloc followed by immediate dereference without NULL check). A proper fix would add a NULL check after devm_kzalloc() (e.g., if (!drvdata->i2sctl) return -ENOMEM) or inside lpass_cpu_init_i2sctl_bitfields() before dereferencing.
