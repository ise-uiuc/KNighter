- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported site does not match the target bug pattern. In ftm_rtc_probe(), the direct devm_kzalloc() of struct ftm_rtc (rtc) is properly NULL-checked. The later allocation uses devm_rtc_allocate_device(), which on failure returns an ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM), not NULL. The code correctly checks this with IS_ERR(rtc->rtc_dev) and returns PTR_ERR on failure before any dereference. The subsequent dereference (rtc->rtc_dev->ops) occurs only after the ERR_PTR check, making it safe. Therefore, there is no unchecked dereference of a potentially-NULL devm_kzalloc() result, and the analyzerâ€™s warning is a false positive.
