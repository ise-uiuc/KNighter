- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The target bug pattern requires an unconditional kfree() in a common cleanup label combined with a retry/replay loop that jumps back after cleanup without resetting the pointer, allowing a second kfree() on an already-freed pointer in a subsequent early-exit path. In the reported function ovl_get_fh(), there is no retry/replay loop. The function always returns at the out label after kfree(fh); it never loops back to re-execute earlier code. The pointer fh is a local variable initialized to NULL at function entry, and kfree(fh) is safe even when fh is NULL (e.g., on the fail path before allocation). There is no path that would attempt to free fh twice within a single function execution, nor any loop that would reuse a freed pointer across iterations. Hence, this does not match the specified bug pattern and is not a real double-free issue.
