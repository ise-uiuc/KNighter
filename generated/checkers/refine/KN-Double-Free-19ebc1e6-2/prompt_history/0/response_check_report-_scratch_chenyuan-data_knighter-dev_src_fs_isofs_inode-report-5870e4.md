- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code does not match the target bug pattern. Although there is an unconditional kfree(tmpde) in a common cleanup label (out), there is no retry/replay loop that continues execution after the free. All paths that reach the out label return immediately after freeing tmpde (and similarly out_noread frees tmpde and returns). There is no “should_retry” branch that jumps back to a point before allocation while leaving tmpde as a dangling pointer. The only loop present is the do-while over directory entries, and any goto out breaks out of the loop and returns, preventing further iterations with a freed pointer. Additionally, kfree(NULL) is safe. Therefore, a double free across iterations cannot occur here, and the report is a false positive with respect to the specified bug pattern.
