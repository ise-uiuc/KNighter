Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker flags functions that have an unconditional kfree() in a cleanup label and any backward goto after that free, without ensuring there is a real retry/replay loop in which the freed pointer is re-visited before being reinitialized or reallocated. It also does not require an actual allocation of the same pointer between the retry label and the cleanup label. This overly-syntactic approach can spuriously match normal error-cleanup patterns (like in fs/afs/addr_prefs.c) where there is no retry loop.
- Fixes:
  1. Require that the backward goto (restart) is followed by at least one allocation/assignment-from-allocator of the same pointer between the restart label and the cleanup free.
  2. Define the “mitigation point” as the earliest of:
     - a reset to NULL for the pointer after the restart label, or
     - the first allocation of the pointer after the restart label.
     Only report if there exists an early goto to the cleanup label strictly between the restart label and this mitigation point.
  3. Keep existing “reset between free and restart goto” guard.
- Edge cases:
  - Correctly handle variable initialization to NULL before the restart label (not a mitigation for later iterations).
  - Consider allocator calls via a reasonable set of kernel allocators (kmalloc/kzalloc/kcalloc/kvzalloc/kmemdup/krealloc/kvmalloc/kvmalloc_array/kstrdup/kstrndup), and any direct call expression returning a pointer (to reduce false negatives) while still requiring it to be an assignment to the same pointer variable.
  - Continue excluding self-cleanup jumps (goto to the same cleanup label).
- Compatibility: The solution uses only AST visitors and basic AST APIs available in Clang-18. No API removals or changes to includes. No analyzer ProgramState needed.
