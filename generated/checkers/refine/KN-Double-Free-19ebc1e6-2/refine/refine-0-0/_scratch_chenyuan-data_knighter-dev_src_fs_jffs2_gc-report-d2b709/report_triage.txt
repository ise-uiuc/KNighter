- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code does not match the target bug pattern. In this function, there is a single retry via a backward goto to the "retry" label that occurs only before entering the common cleanup. All paths that go to the "out_node" label execute kfree(node) and then immediately return; there is no loop or jump back to "retry" after the cleanup. Therefore, the freed pointer cannot persist into another iteration within the same invocation. The hallmark of the target pattern—unconditional kfree in a common cleanup combined with a retry/replay loop that restarts after cleanup without resetting the pointer—is absent. Here, node is never freed prior to the retry, and once freed at out_node, the function returns, preventing any second free in the same call.
