Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker incorrectly treats any backward goto after the cleanup free as a “restart” candidate, including gotos that target the same cleanup label. In code like fs/jffs2/gc.c, a later “goto out_node;” after the cleanup is unrelated to restarting the function and is unreachable from the cleanup due to an earlier return. Because the checker does not exclude self-targeting cleanup gotos, it flags a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  - Exclude gotos whose target is the same cleanup label that contains the free. A restart goto must point to a label distinct from the cleanup label.
  - Keep all existing logic, including the early-goto window from restart label to the earliest post-restart assignment, to preserve detection of true positives (e.g., smb2_set_ea pattern).
  - Keep Clang-18 compatibility and do not remove any existing includes.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - This change narrows restart detection in a way that does not suppress true positives, because valid buggy code (like smb2_set_ea) uses a restart label distinct from the cleanup label.
  - It avoids spurious reports where the only backward goto after cleanup is a self-targeting cleanup jump, which cannot form a retry loop.
  - No change to path-sensitive behavior; still an AST structural checker.
