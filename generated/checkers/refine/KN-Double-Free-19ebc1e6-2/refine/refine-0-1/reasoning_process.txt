Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any backward goto after a cleanup free as a retry candidate, even when that goto is unreachable from the cleanup (e.g., because of an intervening return), and it also unconditionally flags when no post-restart assignment is found. This leads to false positives like the isofs case.
- Fixes:
  1. Require CFG reachability from the cleanup free to the backward goto to consider it a true retry edge. This filters out cases where a return or unconditional exit makes the backward goto unreachable from the cleanup.
  2. Only warn if there exists at least one “early goto to cleanup” after the restart label and before the first reassignment. Remove the incorrect unconditional flagging when no reassignment is found; instead, require an actual early goto to cleanup in that region and that it is reachable from the restart label in the CFG.
  3. Keep existing checks that avoid self-jumps to the cleanup label and that look for a reset-to-NULL between the free and the retry goto.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The new CFG reachability checks avoid false positives in functions that have structured cleanups with immediate returns after free.
  - For the target buggy code (smb2_set_ea), both reachability conditions are satisfied: the retry goto is directly after cleanup and reachable; there are early gotos to the cleanup before re-allocation; no NULL reset occurs. The checker will continue to flag it.
  - If CFG indexing fails (should be rare), the checker will conservatively avoid reporting to prevent false positives.
- API compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs (CFG via AnalysisDeclContext). Does not remove any existing include; adds necessary includes for CFG and maps.
