Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker treats any backward goto after a cleanup free as a potential retry loop without verifying that it is actually a replay/retry jump and that there is an early goto-to-cleanup before the (re)allocation of the freed pointer. In the false positive function (ovl_get_fh), gotos target the cleanup label itself and there is no retry/replay loop. The checker also misses validating that the restart goto is under a conditional (as in the intended bug) and that there is a true allocation segment between the restart label and the cleanup free.
- Fixes:
  1. Skip self-cleanup jumps (already present) and additionally require the restart goto to be inside a conditional (IfStmt) to match real replay/retry patterns like the smb2_set_ea bug.
  2. Track allocation sites (kmalloc/kzalloc/…) of the pointer and require that there is an allocation between the restart label and the cleanup free.
  3. Require evidence of an early goto to the cleanup label between the restart label and the earliest allocation of the pointer (this models the “second iteration early exit before reallocation” risk).
  4. Keep the existing “p reset to NULL between free and restart?” safety rule; if reset, do not warn.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Self-cleanup gotos and functions without any backward retry goto will no longer be flagged.
  - The checker still reports the intended smb2_set_ea bug, because it has a conditional restart goto, an allocation of ea between replay_again and the cleanup, and early gotos to the cleanup before allocation on the retry path.
  - To minimize regressions, allocation detection recognizes common kernel allocation names (kzalloc/kmalloc/etc.). This is sufficient to hit the target bug and avoid the reported FP.
- Compatibility: The solution is AST-only and compatible with Clang-18. No includes are removed. We added local helpers only.
