Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker identifies a backward goto after a cleanup free purely by source order. In drivers/pci/slot.c, there is a return statement between the cleanup free and a later backward goto to the same function’s cleanup label. That goto is unreachable from the cleanup path in the same invocation, but the checker doesn’t model reachability, so it falsely concludes there is a retry loop.
- Fix: Track return statements and treat them as barriers. When considering any candidate “restart” backward goto, discard it if there exists a return statement strictly between the free site and the goto site. Also keep the existing filter that ignores self-cleanup gotos (goto to the same cleanup label). This eliminates the false positive without suppressing the real smb2_set_ea() bug, which has no return between cleanup and the backward goto to replay_again.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - This is a conservative pruning: it might miss a bug in rare cases where a return lies textually between the free and the goto but is unreachable on the relevant path to the goto. That is uncommon in the kernel’s typical replay/cleanup patterns, and the target buggy code remains detected.
  - We maintain the safety check for reset-to-NULL between the free and the goto and for an early goto-to-cleanup after the restart label and before the earliest assignment, avoiding regressions in true-positive detection.
- Compatibility: The changes only add AST traversal for ReturnStmt and do not rely on any APIs beyond Clang 18. No includes are removed.
