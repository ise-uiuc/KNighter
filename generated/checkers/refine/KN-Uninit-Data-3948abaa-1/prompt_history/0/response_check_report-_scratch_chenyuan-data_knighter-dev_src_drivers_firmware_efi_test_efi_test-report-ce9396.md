- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: Although the buffer is allocated with kmalloc and later copied to userspace, the number of bytes copied (datasize) is controlled by the EFI runtime service efi.get_variable(), which on success is specified to write exactly datasize bytes into the provided buffer and to update the datasize output accordingly. The code also guards against copying more than was allocated (prev_datasize < datasize â†’ error). There is no struct padding involved; it's a raw byte buffer, and only the bytes reported by the producer (EFI) are copied. The reported pattern (kmalloc followed by copy_to_user without ensuring full initialization) does not apply here because the producer function is responsible for fully initializing the exact region copied. In the absence of evidence that efi.get_variable() can return success while leaving part of the reported datasize uninitialized, this is a false positive relative to the target bug pattern.
