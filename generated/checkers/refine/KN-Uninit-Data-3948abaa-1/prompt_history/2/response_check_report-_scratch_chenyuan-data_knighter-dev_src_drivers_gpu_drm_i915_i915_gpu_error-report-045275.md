- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported pattern does not match the target bug pattern. The code allocates a byte buffer with kmalloc(count) and then calls i915_gpu_coredump_copy_to_buffer(error, buf, *pos, count). The return value ret is then used as the exact size passed to copy_to_user. By contract and naming, i915_gpu_coredump_copy_to_buffer is a writer that fills the provided buffer and returns the number of bytes actually written, which must be â‰¤ count. Only those ret bytes are copied to userspace. Any kmalloc tail beyond ret is not exposed. There is no struct padding involved, and no evidence that ret exceeds the number of bytes initialized in buf. Therefore, there is no uninitialized memory leak here, and zero-initializing the buffer (kzalloc/memset) would be unnecessary.
