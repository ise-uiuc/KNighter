- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The buffer copied to userspace is a plain char array (no struct padding) allocated as kmalloc(bytes). It is only copied when ret == 0, which in this driver indicates wlcore_raw_read completed successfully. wlcore_raw_read takes the exact size (bytes) and, on success, fills the entire buffer; otherwise it returns a negative error and the code does not call copy_to_user. There is no path where uninitialized bytes are copied: all error paths skip the copy, and on success the device read populates the whole buffer. Hence, this does not match the target bug pattern of copying partially initialized kmalloc memory.
