- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The kmallocâ€™ed buffer (addrs) is only copied to userspace up to bytes_copied, which is exactly the sum of the addrlen values for each address appended. Each chunk appended is written via memcpy from a fully populated temporary (temp) that was itself filled by memcpy from a kernel-maintained address entry (addr->a), and the code copies exactly addrlen bytes per entry. The pointer into the buffer is advanced by addrlen, so there are no gaps/holes. If no addresses are present, bytes_copied is 0 and nothing is copied. Therefore, every byte in the range [0, bytes_copied) is initialized before copy_to_user, and there is no information leak from uninitialized kmalloc memory. This does not match the target bug pattern.
