- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: Although a kmallocâ€™d buffer is copied to userspace, only the bytes that are fully initialized are copied. The flow is:
  - size is clamped to MAX_KFIFO_SIZE; buf = kmalloc(size).
  - Under spinlock, to_copy = kfifo_len(&client->fifo); if zero, bail out before any copy_to_user.
  - to_copy = min(size, to_copy).
  - ret = kfifo_out(&client->fifo, buf, to_copy) is executed while still holding the lock, so no concurrent modification can reduce the available data. Given that there are at least to_copy bytes available, kfifo_out will write exactly to_copy bytes into buf.
  - ret is checked to be > 0; then copy_to_user(user, buf, to_copy) copies exactly the initialized region.

Thus, every byte passed to copy_to_user is initialized by kfifo_out. There is no scenario where uninitialized tail/padding from kmalloc is exposed because the copy size equals the number of bytes written. This does not match the target bug pattern (no uninitialized data leak), and no fix (e.g., kzalloc/memset) is required.
