- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: Although lbuf is allocated with kmalloc, the code only copies to userspace the exact number of bytes that were just initialized by sprintf/snprintf. In all control-flow paths, len is set from either sprintf(lbuf, "invalid") or snprintf(lbuf, 1024, "..."), both of which write exactly len characters at the beginning of lbuf. Before copy_to_user, len is optionally clamped to count, so the copied region is always fully initialized. No uninitialized tail/padding within the copied range is exposed. This does not match the target bug pattern (no copy_to_user of uninitialized bytes), so the report is a false positive.
