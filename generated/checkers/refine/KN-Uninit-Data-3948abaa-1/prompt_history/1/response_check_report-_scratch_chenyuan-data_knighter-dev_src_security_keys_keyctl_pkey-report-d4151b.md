- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported site allocates a buffer with kmalloc, passes it to the asymmetric key operation (asym_eds_op), and then copies only the number of bytes returned by that operation (ret) to userspace. The target bug pattern requires copying a region that is not guaranteed to be fully initialized. Here, by API contract, asym_eds_op writes exactly the number of bytes it returns, so copy_to_user(_out, out, ret) copies only initialized data. There is no copying of the entire allocated buffer or of structure padding. This matches common kernel patterns for crypto operations, and there is no associated fix patch changing this to kzalloc/memset, indicating no real bug. Any failure to initialize the exact number of returned bytes would be a bug in the provider implementation, not in this code path, and does not match the target pattern.
