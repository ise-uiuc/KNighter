- Decision: Bug
- Reason: The function do_insnlist_ioctl allocates a heap buffer with kmalloc_array (not zeroed) and later copies insns[i].n unsigned ints from that buffer to userspace via copy_to_user. For read-only instructions (INSN_MASK_READ set, INSN_MASK_WRITE not set), the buffer is not initialized via copy_from_user, and initialization relies solely on parse_insn(). The code does not enforce that parse_insn() fully initializes all insns[i].n elements; it only checks ret < 0, and unconditionally copies insns[i].n elements to userspace regardless of the number of elements actually written. This can leak uninitialized kmalloc memory (or stale contents from prior iterations) to userspace. This matches the target bug pattern: copying a kmallocâ€™d buffer to userspace without guaranteeing full initialization. A suitable fix would be to use kcalloc/kzalloc for the buffer or to zero/initialize the exact region before copy_to_user, or to copy only the number of elements actually produced.
