Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports a false positive when a kmalloc’ed bounce buffer is filled by a “producer” function that returns the exact number of bytes written, and that same return value is used as the length for copy_to_user. The current checker doesn’t recognize i915_gpu_coredump_copy_to_buffer (and similar producer functions) as safely initializing the buffer up to the returned length, so it warns incorrectly.
- Fix approach:
  1. Generalize producer detection to functions that return the number of bytes written into an output buffer, using name heuristics (e.g., functions containing “copy_to_buffer”, scnprintf/snprintf family). Track the buffer-to-return-symbol mapping in ProgramState (ProducerLenSymMap).
  2. Strengthen the comparison between the copy_to_user length and the producer’s return value by peeling casts and simple symbolic wrappers to match the underlying symbol.
  3. Keep existing zero-initialization and explicit memset/memcpy tracking intact.
  4. Maintain detection of the true positive pattern (kmalloc + partially initialized struct copied to user). The new suppression only triggers when both the source buffer and the length symbol match the producer call; the do_sys_name_to_handle path won’t match, so the warning remains.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Avoid over-suppression by only accepting producer heuristics for functions with names strongly indicating “writes to buffer and returns bytes” (e.g., *copy_to_buffer*, scnprintf/snprintf). We require symbol equality of copy length and the producer’s return symbol, and buffer region identity, so the suppression remains tight.
  - Handle casts on the length symbol to avoid spurious mismatches.
  - Preserve Clang-18 API compatibility and existing includes.
- Implementation details:
  - Add helper to peel casted symbolic values.
  - Add heuristic function functionLikelyReturnsWriteLen to recognize new producers and identify the likely out-buffer argument.
  - Integrate new producer recognition into checkPostCall and reuse existing ProducerLenSymMap-based suppression.
  - Keep existing tracking of InitPrefix, ZeroInitSizeMap, and WriteCountMap.
