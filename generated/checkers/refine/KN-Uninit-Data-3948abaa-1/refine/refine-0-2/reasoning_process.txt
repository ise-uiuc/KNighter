Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only models explicit zeroing (memset/memzero) and a few producer APIs where the produced length equals the copied length symbol. It does not recognize the common pattern where a kmalloc'ed buffer is initialized via snprintf/scnprintf and the copy_to_user length is provably no greater than what snprintf produced (often via a min expression), hence reporting a false positive in fs/ceph/dir.c.
- Fix approach:
  1) Model snprintf/scnprintf/vsnprintf/vscnprintf (and friends) as “producer” functions that return the number of initialized bytes in the destination buffer, and store that return symbol in ProducerLenSymMap for the destination buffer.
  2) In isFalsePositiveDueToProducer(), instead of requiring exact symbol equality between the copy_to_user length and the producer length, attempt to prove copy_len <= produced_len, or copy_len + offset <= produced_len when copying from buf + offset. Use the constraint manager via assume on relational symbolic expressions to determine if the inequality is provably true along the current path.
  3) Keep existing handling for producer-with-status (e.g., get_variable) where success must be proven for suppression.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - We only suppress if the relation can be proven by the constraint manager; otherwise we still warn. This avoids suppressing real bugs such as copying a fixed buffer size after snprintf (which could still leak uninitialized tail).
  - For offsets, we try to detect simple pointer arithmetic “buf + off” and verify copy_len + off <= produced_len. If we can’t extract an offset, we still try the simpler copy_len <= produced_len check; suppress only if provable.
  - We do not mark the entire buffer as initialized up to its capacity; we only model “initialized length” and verify comparisons, which prevents regressions where a fixed larger size is copied.
- Compatibility: Only uses Clang-18 APIs already included. No includes removed. Uses provided helper functions.
