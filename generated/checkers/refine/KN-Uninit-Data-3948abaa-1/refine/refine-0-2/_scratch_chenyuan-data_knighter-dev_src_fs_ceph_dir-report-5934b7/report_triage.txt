- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The code allocates dfi->dir_info with kmalloc but immediately fills the buffer with snprintf and uses the returned length (dfi->dir_info_len) to bound copy_to_user. Thus, only the bytes initialized by snprintf are ever copied to userspace. The target bug pattern requires that uninitialized padding/tail bytes from a kmalloc buffer be exposed via copy_to_user, which does not occur here.

Feasibility of truncation/OOB: bufsize is 1024. The formatted output consists of 8 lines with fixed-width numeric fields (seven times %20lld and one %10lld.%09ld). Even in worst-case 64-bit values (including sign and expansion beyond minimum width for rctime), the total length remains well under 1024 (on the order of ~300 bytes). Therefore snprintf will not truncate, and dfi->dir_info_len will match the number of characters actually initialized in the buffer. The subsequent copy_to_user copies at most dfi->dir_info_len bytes, which are fully initialized. There is no information leak and no need for kzalloc/memset in this context.
