Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker does not model device-read functions (e.g., wlcore_raw_read) that fully initialize a kmalloc’ed buffer before copy_to_user. As a result, it flags a false positive when the buffer is properly filled by such a call and then copied to userspace with the same length.
- Fix: Add a robust, conservative model for “writer-like” functions (read/recv-style APIs) that write into a destination buffer for a supplied length. Record that symbolic “last-write length” for the kmalloc region along with offset 0. At copy_to_user, suppress the warning when the copied length is the same symbol as the last write and the write started at offset 0.
- Safety:
  - The model only applies when the destination is a kmalloc-tracked region and only suppresses if the last write started at offset 0 and used the same length symbol as copy_to_user.
  - We require the buffer pointer to be non-const and the length argument to be adjacent in the call (buf, len) to avoid over-matching.
  - Function name heuristics (prefix “read”, contains “_read”, “raw_read”, “bulk_read”, or “recv” variants) avoid matches like “thread”.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Subregion writes (e.g., struct field pointers like handle->f_handle) won’t suppress unless the write started at base offset 0; this keeps the checker detecting the real bug (do_sys_name_to_handle) where only part of the struct is initialized but copy_to_user includes padding.
  - Symbolic length handling is supported; if the copy length equals the prior writer length symbol, suppression applies, but path sensitivity still ensures typical error checks (e.g., ret < 0) are respected.
- Clang-18: Uses stable APIs and existing includes; no includes removed. Adds only new helper in the checker and state usage already defined.
