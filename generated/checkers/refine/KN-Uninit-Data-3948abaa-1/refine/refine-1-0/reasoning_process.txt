Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker does not model initialization performed by formatting routines like sprintf/snprintf that return the number of bytes written into the buffer. As a result, when the returned length is used as the copy length in copy_to_user, the checker still assumes the buffer is uninitialized and reports a leak.
- Fix:
  - Model the sprintf-family as “producers” that initialize a prefix of the buffer whose length equals the function’s return value.
  - Record the producer length symbol in program state (reusing ProducerLenSymMap).
  - Suppress the diagnostic if the copy_to_user length symbol equals the producer-returned length symbol, or the path condition proves it is less-than-or-equal to the producer length (so partial copies are also considered safe).
- Keep existing detection intact for the target buggy code: no formatting producers there, so the warning remains.
- Edge cases:
  - For snprintf/vsnprintf, the return value is the would-be length; even if it exceeds the buffer size, this is not an uninitialized-kmalloc-byte leak. Our checker focuses on initialized-prefix leaks, not OOB; the suppression will not hide the target bug class.
  - We continue to honor memset/memzero_explicit modeling and alias tracking.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Only use stable analyzer and SVal APIs; no include changes.
