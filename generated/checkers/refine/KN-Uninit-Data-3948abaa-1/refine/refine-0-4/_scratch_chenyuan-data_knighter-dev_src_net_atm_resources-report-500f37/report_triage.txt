- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning claims a kmalloc + copy_to_user information leak, but in atm_getnames the kmallocâ€™ed buffer is fully initialized before copying. The code:
  - Locks atm_dev_mutex, counts the number of devices to compute size = dev_count * sizeof(int).
  - Allocates tmp_buf of exactly that size.
  - Still under the same mutex, iterates the device list again and writes exactly one int per device: every byte in [tmp_buf, tmp_buf + size) is written (no structures/padding, just a flat int array).
  - Only then unlocks and calls copy_to_user(buf, tmp_buf, size).
  The mutex prevents list mutations between counting and filling, so the fill length equals the allocated/copy length. There is no tail or padding left uninitialized, and size can also be zero (copy_to_user with size 0 is harmless). This does not match the target bug pattern; zero-initialization (kzalloc/memset) is unnecessary here.
