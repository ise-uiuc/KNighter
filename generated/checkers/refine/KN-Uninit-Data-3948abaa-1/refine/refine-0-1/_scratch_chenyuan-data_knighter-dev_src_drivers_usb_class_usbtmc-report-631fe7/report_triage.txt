- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported path does not match the target bug pattern. In usbtmc_ioctl_request:
  - buffer is kmallocâ€™ed only when wLength > 0.
  - For IN control transfers, usb_control_msg fills the buffer with data from the device and returns the exact number of bytes transferred (rv >= 0).
  - The subsequent copy_to_user copies exactly rv bytes, not the full allocated length. Thus, only bytes that were written by the USB core are exposed to userspace; any padding/tail beyond rv remains un-copied.
  - If rv <= 0, the code either errors out (rv < 0) or skips copy_to_user (rv == 0).
  - This avoids the uninitialized-memory leak pattern (which would require copying a larger, potentially uninitialized region such as request.req.wLength or a fixed struct size).

Therefore, the analyzer warning is a false positive; no kernel info leak occurs here.
