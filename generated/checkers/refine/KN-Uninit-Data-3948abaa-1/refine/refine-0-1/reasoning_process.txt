Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker does not model producer functions that fill a kmalloc'ed buffer and return the exact number of initialized bytes (rv). In the reported false positive, usb_control_msg initializes at most rv bytes, and only rv bytes are copied to userspace, which is safe. Without modeling this producer/length relation, the checker flags it.
- Fix: Teach the checker to recognize usb_control_msg as a producer: it writes to its data buffer argument and returns the exact number of bytes written. Record the return-value symbol as the buffer’s initialized length in ProducerLenSymMap. Reuse the existing suppression in isFalsePositiveDueToProducer, which already suppresses when copy_to_user’s length symbol matches the recorded producer length symbol.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - Direction (IN/OUT) is determined on the code path by guards; copying to user only happens in IN paths, so we do not need to pattern-match the direction argument.
  - No effect on the targeted buggy pattern (do_sys_name_to_handle): there is no usb_control_msg and the copy length is not equal to any producer-returned symbol. The checker continues to diagnose it.
  - Existing explicit memset/memzero tracking remains intact.
  - We clear producer info on new allocations to avoid stale mappings.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Uses standard CSA APIs; no new includes.
