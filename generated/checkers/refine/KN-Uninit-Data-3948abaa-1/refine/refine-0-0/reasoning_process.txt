Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker assumes kmalloc’d buffers are uninitialized unless memset/memzero_explicit is seen. It does not model producer APIs that fully initialize a kmalloc’d buffer according to a size out-parameter and a success return. In efi_runtime_get_variable(), efi.get_variable writes exactly datasize bytes on success, which is then copied to user; the checker misses this initialization and reports a false positive.
- Fix overview:
  - Add state to track “producer-initialized” buffers: map the kmalloc’d buffer region to the symbol of the producer’s length out-parameter and the symbol of the producer’s return status.
  - Recognize known producer functions (here: get_variable). On return, record:
    - The buffer argument’s base region.
    - The symbol of the dereferenced size out-parameter.
    - The return value symbol.
  - When seeing copy_to_user, suppress the warning iff:
    - The source buffer matches a producer-initialized buffer.
    - The copy length’s symbol equals the recorded size symbol; and
    - Optionally (when constraints make it provable), the recorded return-status symbol is constrained to success (0). If not provably true, we still require the length-symbol match to avoid suppression in unrelated cases.
  - Preserve existing functionality: Explicit zeroing via memset/memzero still suppresses, non-producer flows are unaffected. Don’t touch includes. Maintain Clang-18 API.
  - Edge cases/regressions:
    - If the copy uses a different length, no suppression.
    - If producer didn’t run or length pointer is NULL, no suppression.
    - Reallocation resets producer state to avoid stale mappings.
    - Aliases handled via existing alias map and canonicalization.
