Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only treats “zero-initialization” (kzalloc, memset, memzero_explicit) and some producer APIs as sufficient initialization. It doesn’t recognize element-wise stores that fully initialize only the portion of a kmalloc’ed buffer that is later copied to userspace. In the reported false positive, the code fills event[i] elements and copies exactly cnt*sizeof(struct) bytes, but the checker can’t see those element-wise writes and therefore warns.
- Fixes:
  1) Track element-wise writes into kmalloc’ed buffers. When we see a store into an ElementRegion of a tracked kmalloc buffer, mark the base buffer as “elements written”. Also try to extend a conservative “initialized prefix size” when offsets are known and contiguous.
  2) Model memcpy as initialization (like memset), so explicit byte-wise init is recognized.
  3) Track constant allocation sizes for kmalloc/kzalloc/kmalloc_array and use them to prove the copy length is bounded by the allocation size. Suppress warnings if we detected element-wise filling and the copy is within the allocation size.
  4) Handle kfree to clean state.
  5) Keep all existing behavior for the target bug pattern: the do_sys_name_to_handle() code doesn’t do element-wise filling; thus it still triggers a report.
- Edge cases/regressions:
  - We only suppress when we have evidence of element-wise initialization and the copy length is bounded by the allocation size (constant or inferred max). We still report when only struct fields are written (covers do_sys_name_to_handle).
  - We still report when the copy length is known and exceeds the initialized prefix tracked by the checker.
  - Zero-length copies are ignored.
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 Static Analyzer APIs (MemRegion::getAsOffset, program state maps/sets, etc.). No include removals.
