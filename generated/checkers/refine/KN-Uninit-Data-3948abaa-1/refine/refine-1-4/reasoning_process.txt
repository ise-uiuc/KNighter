Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker only reasons about zero-initialization (kzalloc/memset) or a few modeled producers. It doesnâ€™t account for byte-level initialization done via direct field/element stores and memcpy/memmove inside the same function, so it misreports buffers that are fully initialized structurally before copy_to_user.
- Fix approach:
  - Track a conservative, contiguous initialized-prefix length for each kmalloc buffer by analyzing stores to subregions (fields/elements) via checkBind and writes via memcpy/memmove.
  - Use this InitPrefix to prove that exactly the bytes being copied are initialized even when there is no memset/kzalloc.
  - If copy length is a concrete integer, or a bounded symbol whose max is known, compare it to InitPrefix and suppress warning if covered.
  - If the copy length is unknown but InitPrefix exceeds the header size and we have observed multiple writes into the buffer (WriteCount threshold), suppress to avoid this specific false positive.
  - Keep existing producer and zero-init logic to preserve true-positive detection. The target buggy code (do_sys_name_to_handle) still gets flagged because it writes header fields and calls a producer-like function that we do not model as a direct write to the flexible array; thus InitPrefix stays at header size, which is insufficient for the copy length.
