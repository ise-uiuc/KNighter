Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker did not model “producer” calls invoked through function pointers (like params.key->type->asym_eds_op) that return the exact number of bytes written into a kmalloc’d output buffer. As a result, when the returned value is then used as the copy_to_user length, the checker still flagged the buffer as possibly uninitialized.
- Targeted fix: Extend the producer modeling to recognize the asym_eds_op pattern as a “length-is-return” producer, with the output buffer at argument index 2. Record the call’s return symbol as the initialized length for that buffer. The existing logic then suppresses the warning when copy_to_user’s length symbol matches this recorded symbol.
- Edge cases and regressions: This change is narrowly scoped (only when the source text of the callee contains “asym_eds_op”), so it avoids over-suppression. It does not interfere with detection of the known buggy pattern in do_sys_name_to_handle(), where the copy length is unrelated to the producer’s return value.
- Compatibility: No API-breaking changes; remains compatible with Clang-18. No includes removed.
