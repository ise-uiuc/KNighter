- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported path does not match the target bug pattern. In dpaa2_console_read(), kbuf is allocated with size = bytes. When bytes > bytes_end, the code copies exactly bytes_end bytes from I/O into kbuf (memcpy_fromio(kbuf, ..., bytes_end)) and then copies exactly those bytes to userspace (copy_to_user(buf, kbuf, bytes_end)). Although kbuf is larger than bytes_end, the uninitialized tail is never copied to userspace in this first transfer. The remaining data is then handled by resetting pointers, reducing bytes by bytes_end, and performing a second memcpy_fromio(kbuf, ..., bytes) followed by copy_to_user(buf, kbuf, bytes). In that second transfer, the number of bytes copied equals the number of bytes just initialized. At no point is any uninitialized portion of kbuf passed to copy_to_user. Thus, there is no kernel info leak and no need for kzalloc/memset. The analyzer warning is a false positive.
