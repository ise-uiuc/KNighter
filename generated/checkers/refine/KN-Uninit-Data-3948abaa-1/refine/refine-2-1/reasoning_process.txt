Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker doesn't model memcpy_fromio (and similar "producer" writes), so it fails to learn that kmalloc-backed buffers were initialized for exactly the number of bytes copied to userspace. Additionally, the checker only records initialized bytes when it can constant-fold the length, which often fails for runtime-computed lengths like bytes_end, causing a false positive.
- Fixes:
  1. Model memcpy_fromio and copy_from_user as buffer-initializing calls, just like memcpy/memmove.
  2. When the copy length is non-constant, record the length symbol and the destination offset-of-base for the last write into the buffer. On copy_to_user, if the length symbol matches the last write length symbol and the write started at offset 0, suppress the warning. This precisely suppresses the DPAA2 false positive where the code does memcpy_fromio(kbuf, ..., bytes_end) followed by copy_to_user(..., kbuf, bytes_end).
  3. Keep the existing logic for zero-initialization, explicit memset/memzero, direct field stores, and known producers.
  4. Maintain detection of the target buggy code (do_sys_name_to_handle): no memcpy_fromio or matching producer is seen; only a few field stores happen, so the new suppression does not apply, and the checker continues to report the leak.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - We only suppress when the last write's destination offset is known (or conservatively assumed) to be zero and the length symbols are equal. This avoids overly aggressive suppression.
  - Constant-length writes still update the initialized-prefix map; symbolic writes use the new symbol-based map. Both maps are cleared on fresh allocations.
  - Compatibility with Clang-18 is preserved; only ProgramState maps and existing callback hooks are used.
