Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker warns on kmalloc buffers copied via copy_to_user even when the buffer is fully initialized by kfifo_out. The checker does not model kfifo_out semantics (bytes produced into the destination buffer) and thus misses that the number of bytes requested from kfifo_out (the same symbol used for copy_to_user length) is fully initialized on the successful path, leading to a false positive.
- Fix approach:
  1. Track kfifo_out as a producer: record, for the destination buffer, the symbolic value of the requested length (3rd arg) and the return symbol from kfifo_out.
  2. Suppress copy_to_user warnings when:
     - The buffer matches the one produced by kfifo_out AND
     - The copy_to_user length symbol equals the kfifo_out requested length symbol AND
     - The current path implies kfifo_out returned > 0 (i.e., we are on the success path).
  This mirrors the typical kernel pattern: compute to_copy from kfifo_len, perform kfifo_out(buf, to_copy) under lock, check ret <= 0 path separately, then copy_to_user(buf, to_copy). On the success path, to_copy bytes in buf are initialized.
- Maintain detection of true positives: The do_sys_name_to_handle() case remains detected because there is no kfifo_out producer, no memset/kzalloc, and copying struct+handle_bytes still risks leaking uninitialized bytes.
- Edge cases and mitigations:
  - If code requests more data from kfifo_out than available and copies the requested length instead of the returned length, that is a real bug. Our suppression requires both “same length symbol” and “ret > 0” path implication; however it does not require ret == len. This is mitigated by typical patterns (to_copy = min(size, kfifo_len(...))). To further reduce risk, we require the path to imply ret > 0. The analyzer commonly infers this due to preceding if (ret <= 0) bailout branches.
  - State hygiene: Clear producer state on reallocation to avoid stale info.
  - Clang-18 compatibility: uses REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE and existing analyzer APIs only.
- Implementation details:
  - Add KFifo-specific state maps:
    - KFifoLenArgSymMap: buffer -> symbol of len argument passed to kfifo_out.
    - KFifoRetSymMap: buffer -> symbol of kfifo_out return value.
  - Populate maps on PostCall of kfifo_out.
  - Extend isFalsePositiveDueToProducer to check KFifo maps and path constraint ret > 0.
  - Clear KFifo maps on new allocation events to avoid stale associations.
