- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: In KDGKBSENT, the buffer kbs is allocated with size len = sizeof(user_kdgkb->kb_string). It is then filled via len = strscpy(kbs, func_table[kb_func] ?: "", len). strscpy guarantees that, on success, exactly len+1 bytes (len characters plus the terminating NUL) in kbs are initialized; if truncation would occur, it returns a negative error and the code bails out before any copy_to_user. The subsequent copy_to_user uses exactly len + 1 as the size, matching the number of initialized bytes. Therefore, no uninitialized bytes from the kmalloc buffer are copied to userspace, and the report does not match the target bug pattern.
