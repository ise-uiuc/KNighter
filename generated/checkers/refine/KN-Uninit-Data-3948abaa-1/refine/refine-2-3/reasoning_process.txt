Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker doesn’t model string-producing “producer” routines like strscpy that return the number of bytes copied (excluding the NUL) and are commonly followed by copy_to_user with len+1. The checker only matches len symbols exactly and doesn’t handle len+1, so it incorrectly flags cases that are actually safe.
- Fix approach:
  1. Model strscpy as a producer that initializes the destination buffer for exactly (RetVal + 1) bytes (including the terminating NUL).
  2. Track “affine” lengths: store (Symbol, Addend) pairs for the last write and for producer-derived initialized lengths, where Addend may be 0 or 1 (for strscpy).
  3. In copy_to_user detection, decompose the third argument into a Symbol + Constant form and compare against tracked pairs. Additionally, require that the strscpy return value is non-negative on the current path before suppressing (matching typical kernel usage patterns that check len < 0 before copying).
  4. Maintain and clear all new state in a backward-compatible way, preserving Clang-18 API usage.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Do not suppress when we can’t prove the strscpy return value is non-negative on this path.
  - Preserve existing functionality for producers (like usb_control_msg) and last-write suppression.
  - Continue to warn if copy length exceeds observed initialized prefix when lengths are concrete.
- Implementation details:
  - Add state maps to store addends for producer and last-write lengths.
  - Add modeling for strscpy in checkPostCall to populate these maps.
  - Enhance suppression logic to match CopyLen == BaseLenSym (+/-) Addend and require non-negativity where appropriate.
