Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker models writes for memcpy/memmove/copy_from_user to the region of the pointer variable itself, not to the pointee memory. It also cannot correlate a series of contiguous memcpy writes performed via a moving cursor pointer (buf) with the final copy_to_user length (bytes_copied). As a result, InitPrefix/WriteCount information is not recorded for the allocated buffer, and the checker flags a false positive even though the code copies exactly the number of bytes that were written contiguously.
- Fixes:
  1) Correctly model writes to the pointee region of the destination pointer in memcpy/memmove/copy_from_user by dereferencing the pointer argument to obtain the pointee MemRegion. This allows the checker to attribute writes to the kmalloc buffer rather than the pointer variable.
  2) Track a precise suppression pattern for the common idiom: memcpy(buf, ..., lenSym); buf += lenSym; bytes_copied += lenSym; copy_to_user(..., addrs, bytes_copied). Implement this with new ProgramState maps:
     - LenSymToBaseMap: maps the most recent memcpy len SymbolRef to the kmalloc base region written.
     - AccumLenVarForBaseMap: maps the kmalloc base region to the accumulator variable’s MemRegion when we observe X += lenSym immediately after memcpy.
     These allow us to suppress when copy_to_user length is the accumulator variable associated with the same base buffer, proving that the copied range is exactly the sum of contiguous writes performed via the cursor.
  3) Make recordSymbolicWrite increment WriteCount for the correct base even when the exact byte offset is unknown, but only store LastWriteOffset when a concrete offset is known.
  4) Keep existing producer-based suppressions and last-write-length symbol suppression.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - The new suppression only triggers when we see the local pattern that ties memcpy’s length symbol to an accumulator via += and then uses that accumulator in copy_to_user. This is conservative and avoids broadly suppressing potential real bugs.
  - True positives like the target buggy code (do_sys_name_to_handle with kmalloc and struct fields initialization without zeroing) are unaffected because they do not use the memcpy/accumulator pattern.
  - Maintains compatibility with Clang-18 API and does not remove any includes.
