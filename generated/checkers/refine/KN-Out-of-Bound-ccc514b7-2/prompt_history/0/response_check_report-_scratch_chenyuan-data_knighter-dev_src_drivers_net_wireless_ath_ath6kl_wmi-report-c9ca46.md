- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The warning claims an OOB caused by iterating over NUM_NL80211_BANDS (bound reportedly 6) while indexing sc->supp_rates[band], whose array length is ATH6KL_NUM_BANDS (size 2). However, the code places a guard before any indexing into sc->supp_rates[band]:

  - Control flow:
    - for (band = 0; band < NUM_NL80211_BANDS; band++) {
      - sband = ar->wiphy->bands[band];   // safe: bands[] is sized for NUM_NL80211_BANDS
      - if (!sband) continue;             // skip if no band defined
      - if (WARN_ON(band >= ATH6KL_NUM_BANDS)) break;  // guard against out-of-range for supp_rates
      - ratemask = rates[band];
      - supp_rates = sc->supp_rates[band].rates;
      - ...
    - }

  Because the WARN_ON(band >= ATH6KL_NUM_BANDS) break; executes before any access to sc->supp_rates[band] or rates[band], the loop never indexes sc->supp_rates beyond its size. WARN_ON is not compiled out and returns the condition, so the break reliably prevents the out-of-bounds access.

  This does not match the target bug pattern (indexing a smaller array using the loop index bounded by a larger array) in a way that is actually reachable at runtime. Therefore, the report is a false positive.
