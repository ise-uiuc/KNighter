- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: Although the loop iterates up to NUM_REG_TEMP (likely 4), the code explicitly guards accesses to the smaller array W83627EHF_REG_TEMP_OFFSET (size 3) with “if (i > 2) continue;” before indexing it. Therefore, W83627EHF_REG_TEMP_OFFSET[i] is only evaluated for i in [0, 2], which is within bounds. This does not match the target bug pattern (no out-of-bounds risk), and no fix of the type described is needed.
