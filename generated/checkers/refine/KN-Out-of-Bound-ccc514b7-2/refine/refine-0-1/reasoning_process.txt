Refinment Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports when it sees a loop bounded by a constant equal to one array’s size and also finds another smaller array indexed by the same loop index. It currently suppresses only when it can prove an i-based guard like i < SmallSize or a loop-level break/return after i >= SmallSize. In the false-positive case, the smaller array access is guarded by a mapping idiom: a temporary index inst is computed from i (inst = GET_INST(..., i)), and the access is executed only when inst >= 0. This effectively restricts which i values enter the branch, but the checker doesn’t recognize this guard since it is not a direct comparison on i.
- Fix approach: Add a focused suppression heuristic for the common “mapping guard” idiom:
  1) Detect that the smaller array access is dominated by an if (inst >= 0), if (inst != -1), if (inst > -1), or their equivalent else-branches for inst == -1/inst < 0.
  2) Confirm that inst is computed from i immediately before the guard in the same block (assignment/decl whose RHS references i).
  3) Confirm that within the same guarded branch there exists another array indexed by inst (e.g., arr[inst]) — typical of the instance mapping idiom.
  Only then suppress the warning.
- This keeps the AMD display bug detectable because that code does not involve an instance mapping guard; it just compares A[i] with a condition and returns B[i], so the suppression will not trigger.
- Compatibility: No API changes beyond Clang 18; we continue to use AST-only APIs, getParents, and existing utilities. No includes are removed.
- Edge cases considered: We avoid broadly suppressing any non-i condition; we suppress only when all mapping-guard conditions are met. This minimizes regressions and keeps true positives.
