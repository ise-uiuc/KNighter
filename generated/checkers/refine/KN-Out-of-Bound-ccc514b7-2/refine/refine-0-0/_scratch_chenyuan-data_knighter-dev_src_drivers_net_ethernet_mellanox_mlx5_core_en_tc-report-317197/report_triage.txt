- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The loop iterates over all traffic types (tt from 0 to MLX5_NUM_TT-1), but hp->indir_tir is intentionally sized to MLX5E_NUM_INDIR_TIRS = MLX5_NUM_TT - 1. The code guards the access: for tt == MLX5_TT_ANY (which is the last enum value and equals MLX5_NUM_TT-1), it uses hp->direct_tir and does not index hp->indir_tir. For all other tt values (0..MLX5_NUM_TT-2), it indexes hp->indir_tir[tt], which is within bounds 0..MLX5E_NUM_INDIR_TIRS-1. Therefore, the out-of-bounds access cannot occur. This does not match the target bug pattern because the indexing of the smaller array is properly guarded against the only out-of-range loop index.
