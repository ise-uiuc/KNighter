Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any occurrence where a loop iterates up to a larger bound and indexes a smaller array with the same index, but it doesn’t recognize intra-loop guards that ensure the smaller array isn’t indexed at the out-of-range value. In the reported false positive, the out-of-range access is prevented by a conditional operator (tt == MLX5_TT_ANY ? direct : indir[tt]), where the array access is only evaluated when tt != MLX5_TT_ANY and SmallSize = UB - 1, so tt ∈ [0, SmallSize-1].
- Fix approach:
  - Add precise suppression when the array subscript use is guarded by a branch condition on the loop index (IfStmt or ConditionalOperator) that logically implies i < SmallSize (or i <= SmallSize-1).
  - Handle common patterns: i < SmallSize, i <= SmallSize - 1, i >= SmallSize (else branch), i > SmallSize - 1 (else branch), and the “edge value exclusion” patterns i == SmallSize (else branch) or i != SmallSize (true branch), provided UB == SmallSize + 1.
  - Keep existing “break/return” guard suppression.
- Implementation details:
  - Parse branch conditions and normalize them relative to the loop index.
  - Determine which branch the array subscript belongs to by walking up the AST using ASTContext::getParents and checking subtree containment.
  - Only suppress when the guard provably keeps the index within [0, SmallSize-1].
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Only suppress in narrowly defined, provably safe patterns.
  - Maintain detection for the AMD bug (no such guarding branch exists).
  - Avoid underflow when checking SmallSize - 1.
- Compatibility:
  - Keep existing includes; add minimal includes for parent queries. Ensure Clang-18 API compatibility.
  - No changes to existing utility includes are removed.
