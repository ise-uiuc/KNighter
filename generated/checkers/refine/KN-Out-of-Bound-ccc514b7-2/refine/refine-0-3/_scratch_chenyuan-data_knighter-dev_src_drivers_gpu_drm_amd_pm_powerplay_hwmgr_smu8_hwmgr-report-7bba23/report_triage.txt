- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported loop iterates with bound SMU8_NUM_NBPSTATES, but accesses the smaller array nbp_memory_clock[] only under an explicit guard: if (i < SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK) data->sys_info.nbp_memory_clock[i] = ...;. This prevents out-of-bounds access when SMU8_NUM_NBPSTATES > SMU8_NUM_NBPMEMORYCLOCK. The other array indexed in the loop, nbp_n_clock[], is presumably sized to SMU8_NUM_NBPSTATES and is accessed unconditionally, which is consistent. Thus, the code does not match the target bug pattern (there is an appropriate guard for the smaller array), and there is no real OOB issue here.
