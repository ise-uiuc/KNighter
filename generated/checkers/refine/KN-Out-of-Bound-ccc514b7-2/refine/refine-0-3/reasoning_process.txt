Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports a false positive when the smaller array access is protected by a local “if (i < SmallSize)” guard because the current ancestor-walking logic only follows a single parent chain (Parents[0]). In real ASTs, nodes may have multiple parents (e.g., implicit nodes, cleanup nodes). Restricting to the first parent can miss the relevant enclosing IfStmt, so the suppression in isIndexUseGuardedByBranch never triggers.
- Fix: Make ancestor traversal robust by exploring all parent paths (BFS) to find enclosing IfStmt/ConditionalOperator that constrain the index variable. Do the same for helper routines that rely on parent traversal (findEnclosingIfWithBranch, findDirectCompoundParent). Keep existing guard heuristics but make them apply reliably.
- Edge cases: Preserve detection of the real bug in the AMD DC patch (no guard constraining i to the smaller array’s size). The new logic only suppresses when the enclosing branch on i strictly implies in-range; unrelated conditions like “if (A[i] == x)” do not suppress.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Changes use only ASTContext::getParents and standard Clang APIs.
