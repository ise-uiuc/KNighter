Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker misses the common guarding pattern “if (i > SmallSize-1) continue;” that appears before the smaller array access in the same loop body. The current suppression only recognizes guards with break/return and narrowly-matched conditions (“i >= SmallSize” or “i == SmallSize”). It does not:
  - Recognize continue-based guards,
  - Accept equivalent bounds like “i > SmallSize-1”,
  - Ensure the guard executes before the actual array access when it is not a parent branch.
- Fixes:
  1. Record the earliest small-array access site to avoid suppressing earlier unsafe uses when multiple uses exist.
  2. Add a precise suppression that detects an “early-exit guard before use” at the same compound level or at ancestor compound blocks along the AST path:
     - Find earlier sibling If statements whose then/else branch is a simple early exit (continue/break/return),
     - Parse conditions on the loop index and determine if the exit fires exactly for all out-of-range indices,
     - Only accept continue for conditions that cut off the entire tail (i >= SmallSize or i > SmallSize-1),
     - Accept break/return also for the threshold equality (i == SmallSize) since the loop terminates.
  3. Keep existing branch-parent suppression intact to avoid regressions and ensure we still detect the buggy DCN code.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Multiple A[i]/B[i] accesses: taking the earliest use avoids hiding earlier unsafe accesses,
  - Nested blocks: the guard detection climbs ancestors and checks earlier siblings at each compound level,
  - Continue vs break/return treated differently for equality conditions,
  - Maintains compatibility with Clang-18 API and does not remove any includes.
- Verify no regression on target buggy code: The DCN example lacks an index-based guard on i; the new suppression won’t trigger and the issue remains reported.
