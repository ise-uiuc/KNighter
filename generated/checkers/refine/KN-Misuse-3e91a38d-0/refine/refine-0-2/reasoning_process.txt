Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker reports any memdup_user call if it heuristically thinks there is a multiplication with sizeof in the size argument, but it doesnâ€™t robustly verify that the size argument actually contains a top-level arithmetic multiplication. In some configurations/macros, simple sizeof(...) arguments may pass through implicit casts/parents and be misinterpreted, producing the false positive reported for memdup_user(arg, sizeof(*ldpc)).
- Fix approach:
  - Add a robust AST search that only triggers when the size argument truly contains a BinaryOperator '*' node with one operand being a sizeof (UnaryExprOrTypeTraitExpr). Do not traverse into the operand of a sizeof to avoid spurious matches like sizeof(a*b).
  - Explicitly suppress when the entire argument is a plain sizeof expression (struct duplication, not array).
  - Continue to detect the target buggy pattern such as memdup_user(ptr, 256 * sizeof(u32)) and similar forms regardless of casts or extra parentheses.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Ignore pure sizeof(...) sizes and sizeof(...) wrapped in casts/parens.
  - Still warn for both count * sizeof(T) and sizeof(T) * count, even with casts and parentheses.
  - Do not warn for expressions where the multiplication only appears inside a sizeof (...).
- Compatibility: Uses only Clang-18 public APIs. No removal of includes. No extra dependencies. No state traits needed for this specific false positive.
