- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The target bug pattern concerns using memdup_user() with a size computed as count * element_size (risking integer overflow) instead of memdup_array_user(). In the reported code, the call is ldpc = memdup_user(arg, sizeof(*ldpc)); which copies a single fixed-size struct. There is no multiplication involved, hence no overflow risk from size calculation. Using memdup_array_user() would be inappropriate here since this is not an array copy. Additionally, the return value is properly checked with IS_ERR(). Therefore, this report does not match the target bug pattern and is a false positive.
