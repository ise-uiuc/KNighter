Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fires on any memdup_user(ptr, count * sizeof(T)) call without verifying that the first argument actually points to an array of T. This over-approximation mislabels cases like header+flexible-array copies or pointer-arithmetic-derived pointers as array copies.
- Fix:
  - Only report when the size is exactly Count * sizeof(Element) and:
    - The first argument is a simple pointer expression (DeclRefExpr or a simple cast of it), not pointer arithmetic, not a member access, not taking address of a member.
    - The first argument’s pointee type matches the sizeof element type exactly (ignoring qualifiers).
    - The element type is an integer-like builtin (e.g. u32/u16/etc.). This focuses the checker on the intended array-of-scalars case and avoids common FPs involving arrays of structs used with headers.
  - Keep suppressing plain sizeof(X) sizes.
- Edge cases accounted for:
  - Complex pointer expressions (pointer arithmetic, member access) are suppressed to avoid header+FAM and interior-pointer patterns.
  - void __user * pointers are ignored, unless they can be resolved to a concrete element type through a simple cast chain leading to a DeclRefExpr. Otherwise, we lack type information to prove an array of T.
  - Arrays of structs will be suppressed to reduce FPs in KVM/Btrfs ioctl paths, while still catching the target viafb case (u32 array).
- Regressions:
  - This narrows the checker; some legitimate struct-element array copies won’t be flagged. This is a deliberate trade-off to eliminate the reported false positives while preserving detection of the target bug.
- Clang-18 API: Uses standard AST/CSA APIs available in Clang-18, no removal of includes, and no reliance on unstable interfaces.
