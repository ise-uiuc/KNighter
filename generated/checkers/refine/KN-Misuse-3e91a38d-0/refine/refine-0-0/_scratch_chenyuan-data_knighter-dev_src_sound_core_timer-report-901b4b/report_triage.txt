- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The reported code uses memdup_user(_ginfo, sizeof(*ginfo)) to copy a single fixed-size struct from user space. There is no count * element_size multiplication, no array being copied, and therefore no risk of integer overflow from size computation. The target bug pattern specifically concerns using memdup_user with a size computed as count * elem_size (missing overflow checks) instead of memdup_array_user. Since this code does not perform such a multiplication and is not copying an array, memdup_user is the correct API here. Consequently, the report does not match the target bug pattern and is a false positive.
