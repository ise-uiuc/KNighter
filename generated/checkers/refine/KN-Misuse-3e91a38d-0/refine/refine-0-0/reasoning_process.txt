Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker relied on a textual heuristic that only checks whether the size argument contains both “sizeof” and “*” in its source text. This confuses a unary dereference star in sizeof(*ptr) with a multiplication operator and also matched callee names by substring in the call text, which could hit memdup_user_nul. This led to the reported false positive on memdup_user(_ginfo, sizeof(*ginfo)).
- Fixes:
  1. Match the callee using CallEvent::getCalleeIdentifier() and require exact name "memdup_user".
  2. Only report when the size argument’s AST is actually a BinaryOperator multiplication (BO_Mul) with a sizeof operand. Remove the textual fallback.
  3. Add a small isFalsePositive filter that suppresses reports when the size argument is a pure sizeof expression with no multiplication.
- Edge cases and regressions:
  - Maintains detection for the real bug pattern e.g. memdup_user(argp, 256 * sizeof(u32)).
  - Avoids reporting for memdup_user(ptr, sizeof(*ptr)).
  - Avoids accidental matches on memdup_user_nul or similar due to substring checks.
  - Handles parentheses/implicit casts; macros that expand to a multiplication are still represented as BO_Mul in the AST and will be detected.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Uses CallEvent, CheckerContext, BinaryOperator, and other APIs compatible with Clang 18. No includes removed.
