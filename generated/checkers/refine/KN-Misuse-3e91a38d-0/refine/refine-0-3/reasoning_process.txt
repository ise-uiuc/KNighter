Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fired when it saw any sizeof in the memdup_user size argument because it searched for a multiplication “somewhere” inside the argument. This allowed false positives when the full argument was just sizeof(T) (no multiplication), or when a nested multiply existed inside a larger arithmetic (e.g., n * sizeof(T) + pad), where memdup_array_user is not applicable.
- Fix: Restrict reporting to cases where the top-level expression (ignoring parentheses and casts) is exactly a binary multiplication with exactly one side being a sizeof-expression. Suppress in all other cases, including plain sizeof and compound expressions like add/sub/bitwise with a multiply sub-expression.
- Edge cases:
  - Plain sizeof(...) -> suppressed.
  - sizeof(array type) -> suppressed.
  - Complex expressions that include multiply but are not purely count * sizeof(...) (e.g., n * sizeof(T) + pad) -> suppressed.
  - Both sides sizeof (sizeof(T) * sizeof(U)) -> suppressed.
  - Constant count like 256 * sizeof(u32) -> still reported (target buggy code).
- Compatibility: Uses Clang-18 APIs only, no removed includes, no new program state traits required.
