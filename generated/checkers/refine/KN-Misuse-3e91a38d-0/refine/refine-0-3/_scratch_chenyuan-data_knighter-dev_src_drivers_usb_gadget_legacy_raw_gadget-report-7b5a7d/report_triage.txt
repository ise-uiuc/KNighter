- Decision: NotABug
- Reason: The target bug pattern concerns using memdup_user() with a size computed as count * element_size (risking integer overflow), which should be replaced by memdup_array_user(count, element_size). Here, the code calls memdup_user((void __user *)value, sizeof(*desc)) to copy a single struct usb_endpoint_descriptor. There is no count-based multiplication; sizeof(*desc) is a constant, so no overflow risk exists. The data is not treated as an array, and memdup_array_user is not applicable. Therefore, this report does not match the target pattern and is a false positive.
