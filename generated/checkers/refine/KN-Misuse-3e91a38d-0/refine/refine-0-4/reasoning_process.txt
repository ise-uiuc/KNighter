Refinement Plan:
- Root cause: The checker fired on memdup_user(ptr, sizeof(*obj)) because it only looked for memdup_user regardless of whether the size argument is an array-like multiplication. It did not robustly ensure that the size argument was a multiplication with exactly one sizeof, nor did it track when a variable used as size was derived from such a multiplication. This led to false positives on plain sizeof uses, like in btrfs/ioctl.c.
- Fix approach:
  1. Strictly match the target shape: count * sizeof(elem). Suppress when the size argument is a plain sizeof (no multiplication).
  2. Track the origin of intermediate variables used as the size argument using ProgramState:
     - Mark regions assigned from plain sizeof as SizeofOnly.
     - Mark regions assigned from a multiplication where exactly one side is size-ish (direct sizeof or a variable known to be SizeofOnly) as MulWithSizeof.
     - Clear mapping when a region is assigned something else.
  3. On memdup_user calls, classify the size argument:
     - If it is MulWithSizeof (directly or via tracked variable), report.
     - If it is SizeofOnly, suppress.
  4. Handle assignments both via DeclStmt initializers and BinaryOperator assignments. Invalidate state on region changes.
- Edge cases considered:
  - Multiplying two sizeof-like expressions (sizeof(T) * sizeof(U)) is not warned (not an array count pattern).
  - Variables storing sizeof(...) or count * sizeof(...) are correctly tracked through assignments and initializers.
  - Constants: direct constants like 256 * sizeof(u32) are detected; plain sizeof(struct) is suppressed.
- Clang-18 compatibility: Uses standard CSA APIs and REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE, add-only changes, no include removals.
