### Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is using `kmalloc()` to allocate memory for a buffer that is later copied to user space without properly initializing the allocated memory. This can result in a kernel information leak if the allocated memory contains uninitialized or leftover data, which is then exposed to user space. The root cause is the lack of proper memory initialization after allocation, leading to potential exposure of sensitive kernel data. Using `kzalloc()` instead ensures that the allocated memory is zeroed out, preventing such information leaks.
