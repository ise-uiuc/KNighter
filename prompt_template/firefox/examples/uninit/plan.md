### Plan

1. **Register Program State Map:**
   - Define two maps using `REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE`:
      - Use `REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(UninitMemoryMap, const MemRegion *, bool)` to map memory regions to an initialization flag.
      - A `PtrAliasMap` to track alias relationships. This is needed so that if one pointer is checked, its aliases are also marked as checked.

2. **Track Memory Allocations (`checkPostCall`):**
   - **For `kmalloc`:**
     - Retrieve the call expression and its base `MemRegion`.
     - Mark the region as uninitialized (`true`).
   - **For `kzalloc`:**
     - Retrieve the call expression and its base `MemRegion`.
     - Mark the region as initialized (`false`).

3. **Detect Information Leak (`checkPreCall`):**
   - Identify calls to `copy_to_user`.
   - Retrieve the kernel source argumentâ€™s base `MemRegion`.
   - If the region is flagged as uninitialized in `UninitMemoryMap`, call `reportInfoLeak` to generate a warning.

4. **Bug Reporting (`reportInfoLeak`):**
   - Generate a non-fatal error node.
   - Emit a bug report with a message indicating potential kernel information leakage.
