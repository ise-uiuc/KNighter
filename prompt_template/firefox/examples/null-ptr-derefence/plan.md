### Plan

1. **Create and Manage Program State Maps:**
   - Define two maps using `REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE`:
     - A `PossibleNullPtrMap` that associates `MemRegion`s with a boolean indicating whether they have been NULL-checked (`true` if checked, `false` if unchecked).
     - A `PtrAliasMap` to track alias relationships. This is needed so that if one pointer is checked, its aliases are also marked as checked.

2. **Identify the Relevant Function (`devm_kasprintf`):**
   - Implement an internal helper function `isDevmKasprintf(const CallEvent &Call)`.
   - In `checkPostCall`, if the function is `devm_kasprintf`, mark the return region in `PossibleNullPtrMap` as unchecked (`false`), since it hasn't undergone a NULL check yet.

3. **Marking Pointers as Checked:**
   - Implement a helper function `setChecked(State, Region)` which marks a pointer (and its aliases) as checked in the `PossibleNullPtrMap`.
   - This function is used whenever the checker determines a pointer has been NULL-checked.

4. **Observing Conditions (BranchCondition):**
   - In `checkBranchCondition`, examine the condition:
     - If it looks like `if (!ptr)`, `if (ptr == NULL)`, `if (ptr != NULL)`, or just `if (ptr)`, determine the region being tested.
     - Once identified, call `setChecked(...)` on that region.

5. **Detecting Dereferences (Location):**
   - In `checkLocation`, catch any read/write operation (`*ptr`).
   - If the pointer has a mapping in `PossibleNullPtrMap` and it is still set to `false`, issue a warning (using `C.emitReport(...)`) because the pointer might be `NULL`-not-checked.

6. **Tracking Aliases (Bind):**
   - In `checkBind`, when a pointer is stored into another pointer (e.g., `p2 = p1;`), record this alias in `PtrAliasMap`.
   - When one pointer becomes checked, `setChecked(...)` will update the aliases as well.
   - Do not update the `PossibleNullPtrMap` in the `checkBind` function.
