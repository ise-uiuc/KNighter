### Bug Pattern

The bug pattern is that the function `devm_kasprintf()` can return NULL if it fails to allocate memory. When the return value is not checked and is subsequently dereferenced, it can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This pattern can cause the program to crash if it tries to use the pointer returned by `devm_kasprintf()` without ensuring it is non-NULL.
