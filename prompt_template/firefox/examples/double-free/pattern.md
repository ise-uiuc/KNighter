### Bug Pattern

The bug pattern in the provided patch is the use of `devm_kcalloc()` for allocating memory, which results in automatic memory management by the device-managed allocation API. This can lead to a double free issue when manual deallocation is also performed with functions like `pinctrl_utils_free_map()`. The root cause is combining automatic device-managed memory allocation with manual memory deallocation, which can result in freeing memory twice and cause undefined behavior
