### Bug Pattern

The bug pattern identified in this semgrep rule is a **null pointer dereference vulnerability**. The code directly accesses a field of a PPS (Picture Parameter Set) object without first verifying that the object pointer is not null. 

**Problematic Pattern:**
```cpp
if (pps[id]->field == false) {
    // ... code that processes the condition
}
```

**Root Cause:**
- The code assumes that `pps[id]` is a valid pointer without checking if it's null
- Accessing `pps[id]->field` when `pps[id]` is null leads to undefined behavior
- This can cause application crashes, security vulnerabilities, or unpredictable program behavior

**Vulnerability Type:** CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)

**Risk:** This pattern can lead to:
- Application crashes
- Denial of service attacks
- Potential exploitation in security-critical contexts
- Undefined behavior that may be exploited by attackers
