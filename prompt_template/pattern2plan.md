# Instruction

Please organize a elaborate plan to help to write a CSA
checker to detect the **bug pattern**.

You will be provided with a **bug pattern** description and the corresponding patch to help you undestand this bug pattern.

You will also be provided with some **utility functions** to help organize your plan.
These functions are already implemented and you can include them in your plan.
These functions will be provided in the `Utility Functions` section.

**Please read `Suggestions` section before writing the checker!**

# Suggestions

1. To hook an `if` statement, use the callback function `check::BranchCondition`.

2. If it involves the macro value (like `CMD_XXX`), please use `getNameAsString()` to get the string of the macro value and compare it with the target string.

3. If there are pointer analysis, please use a program state (e.g. `REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)`) and `checkBind` to track the aliasing information.

4. When using `checkBind` for pointer analysis, please use the program state (e.g. `REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE(PtrAliasMap, const MemRegion*, const MemRegion*)`).

5. The report message should be **short** and clear. Use `std::make_unique<PathSensitiveBugReport>` or `std::make_unique<BasicBugReport>` to create a bug report.

# Formatting

Your plan should contain the following information.

1. Decide if it's necessary to customize program states (like `REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE`, `REGISTER_MAP_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE`).

2. Choose callback functions. And for every step, detailedly explain how to implement this callback function.

You only need to tell me the way to implement this checker, extra information like unit testing or documentation is unnecessary.

**Please try to use the simplest way and fewer steps to achieve your goal. But for every step, your response should be as concrete as possible so that I can easily follow your guidance and write a correct checker!**

# Plan

Your plan should follow the format of examples plans
Note, your plan should be concise and clear. Do not include unnecessary information or example implementation code snippets.
